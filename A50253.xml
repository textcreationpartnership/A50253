            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER, ESPECIALLY Thoſe of that CHURCH, to which this AUTHOR was ſometime PASTOR.</head>
            <p>EVery Church is by the Ordinance of Chriſt a Pillar of ſaving truth, holding it forth to be ſeen and read of all men; the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Ordinances adminiſtred in Churches being amongst the chief of the ways whereby the bleſſed God inſtructs and enlightens a dark world in the way of eternal Life. Theſe following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes are part, and but part of thoſe many precious Truths and Teachings held forth by this Servant of Chriſt, in the courſe of about fifteen years Miniſtry, in that Candleſtick in which the Lord made him a ſhining Light. The Prophets do not live for ever, but their Words and Fruit ſhould, yea will live and remain after they are gone to their everlaſting Reſt. Not long after this Author had gone through this Subject God took him to Heaven, (when he wanted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſix months of being ſix and forty years old) by an Impoſthume in his Liver; which; as ſome that were converſant with him judged, hung upon him when he ſtudied and preached theſe Sermons; which, perhaps, was the reaſon, that from the beginning to the finiſhing of them ſo long a ſpace ran out. Having no more time to review them, and make any additions unto the Notes that he prepared for Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they are leſs perfect then otherwiſe they would; and it is not unlike, but that many things ſtudied by him beforehand, and delivered in preaching, eſpecially in the applicatory part (wherein he had an
<pb facs="tcp:96313:3"/>
excellency) are loſt, becauſe not written down by himſelf. Had he lived to have reviewed and prepared theſe Diſcourſes for the Preſs, it is like he would have ſpoken to and cleared up ſome things more fully, and perhaps, on ſecond thoughts, have in ſome paſſages deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf ſomewhat otherwiſe. It is not expected that every one, much leſs critical and captious heads, will ſubſcribe to every thing which they may here meet with. In ſo diffuſe and vaſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſo obſcure a Subject, and ſo untrodden a path, it is no wonder if every one will not tread in juſt the ſame ſteps with him; for there are ſome things wherein he departs from the Sentiments of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned and judicious perſons: His making ſome of the old legal Ordinances Types of the inſtituted Church and Ordinances under the New Teſtament, and our Ordinances the Antitypes of theirs, it may be ſome may not aſſent unto, following therein <hi>Ames Prol. in Pſ. 2.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jeans,</hi> who <hi>(Exam. Exam. p. 241.)</hi> cites <hi>Chamier tom. 4. l. 9. c. 11. Sect. 13, 15. pag. 515. Tilenus Syntag. Part. ult. Diſp. 63. Sect. 12. Ames Bellarm. Enerv. tom. 3. l. 4. c. 7.</hi> to which he might have added thoſe words of his <hi>tom. 3. lib. 1. cap. 4. theſ. 13.</hi> and <hi>lib. 2. cap. 4. theſ. 4.</hi> But others there are who go with this our Author. See <hi>Beza</hi> on <hi>1 Cor. 10.6.</hi> and on <hi>1 Pet. 3.21.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton Holineſs of Church Members chap. 2. ſect. 12,</hi> and <hi>13.</hi> Not to mention any of the Schoolmen, or the elder Writers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians, who are very frequent and very expreſs to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Nor can it be denied that there is a common Nature wherein their Inſtitutions and ours agree, the one being a ſhadow or darker adumbration, the other a more lightſome and lively image of the ſame things. And it is beyond all contradiction, that the Holy Ghoſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth frequently inſtruct us in our Duty with reference to our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, from theirs under the old Teſtament with relation to their typical Ordinances. As for his calling our Inſtitutions the <hi>Antitypes</hi> to theirs, though there ſhould be a truth in that obſervation, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logi Graeci Typum &amp; Antitypum promiſcuè uſurpant pro iiſdem, pro re ſignificatâ nunquam. Jodoc. Laren. apud Twiſſ. Animadv. in Corv. Def. Armin. cont. Tilen. pag. 280.</hi> yet there is a ſtrict and proper acceptation of the word, wherein it may be ſaid, that our Inſtitutions are the Antitypes of theirs: <hi>vid. Jun. Animadv. in Bell.
<pb facs="tcp:96313:3"/>
Contr. 3. lib. 1. cap. 9. not. 25.</hi> and in that ſenſe the Holy Ghoſt uſeth it, <hi>1 Pet. 3.21.</hi> Nor needs any one ſtumble at our Authors uſing it in ſomewhat a different ſignification; for uſage is the Maſter and Rule of Language; <hi>Loquendum cum vulgo, ſentiendum cum doctis.</hi> But it is not for the ſake of ſuch paſſages that theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes are publiſhed, but at the inſtant deſires of many, and for the ſake of that Goſpel-light which ſhines throughout the whole, and which is therein caſt upon ſo great a part of holy Scripture, which was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten not for their uſe only who had the worldly Sanctuary, and were to obſerve thoſe carnal Ordinances: but for ours alſo, who live in theſe better times of the New Teſtament. And though every thing be not ſo clearly and convincingly made out, as ſome perhaps will deſire; yet that the work is ſingularly uſeful will be manifeſt of it ſelf: nor is any humane Writing without its defects; and thoſe which come out after the Authors death, and were not by their own hand finiſhed for the Preſs (which in the fate of this) muſt have allowances beyond others. Beſides that this is a Subject which none, or almoſt none, hath waded through before him. How he was indowed for it, and what he had attained in it, is not for ſo obſcure and incompetent a Pen as writes this, to ſay. If this work find incouraging acceptance, others of his labours may poſſibly be publiſhed hereafter. For beſides this and thoſe three other ſmall Tracts, <hi>viz. his Defenſe of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> againſt the impotent aſſaults of a Popiſh Prieſt, his <hi>Irenicum,</hi> or <hi>Eſſay for Union</hi> among the reforming Parties in theſe Nations, and his <hi>Two Sermons againſt the Ceremonies, on 2 King. 18.4.</hi> which are already printed, there are ſome other works of his not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to ſee the publick Light.</p>
            <p>As to you who were ſometime his Charge, and uſed to ſit under his Miniſtry, this Providence ſhould be looked on by you, as that which adds greatly unto your account. If you be not judicious and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſtians, if you be not living thriving Souls, you will be moſt inexcuſable. God hath made you as a City on an hill, not only by the eminency of place where you ſojourn, but alſo by the luſtre of thoſe Stars in his right hand, whom he hath formerly ſet among you: Thoſe hoary heads, zealous and lively Dr. <hi>Winter,</hi> that mighty man in Prayer, grave and judicious Mr. <hi>Timothy Taylor,</hi> and thoſe of
<pb facs="tcp:96313:4"/>
fewer days, in whom yet was the Inſpiration of the Almighty to give them underſtanding, holy, humble Mr. <hi>Murcot,</hi> and this Author, the clearneſs and weightineſs of whoſe Preaching ſome of you have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious remembrance of, muſt all of them be accounted for unto God one day by you that ſat under their Miniſtry. Dr. <hi>Winter</hi> thought the Joy and Glory of Saints in Heaven receives ſome addition there, as their Works while they were on earth do bring forth fruit here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, grounding this his Judgment on <hi>Jer. 32.19.</hi> and the like Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; ſee his <hi>Epiſtle before Mr.</hi> Murcots <hi>Sermons.</hi> And there are that think godly Miniſters ſhall at the day of Chriſt have the preſenting unto him thoſe that have been converted and ſavingly wrought upon by their Miniſtry. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to have an expectation, that he ſhould preſent the <hi>Corinthians</hi> unto Chriſt as a chaſt Virgin eſpouſed unto the Lord by him, <hi>2 Cor. 11.2.</hi> and he look'd on the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> as his Joy and Crown of glorying before God, not only in this world, <hi>1 Theſſ. 3.9.</hi> but alſo hereafter in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his coming, <hi>1 Theſſ. 2.19, 20.</hi> If the affectionate remembrance of your former Teachers, which ſtill lives in your hearts, and ought ſo to do, ſhall ſtir you up to make a fruitful improvement of ſuch monuments of their labours as are yet with you, whatever advantage ſhall accrue to them who are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a thankleſs world and cloudy sky, certainly you will be gainers unſpeakably. Thoſe Exhortations of the Apoſtle do ſpeak unto you. <hi>Remember thoſe that have had the Rule over you, and have ſpoken to you the Word of God, whoſe Faith follow conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end of their converſation; Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday, to day and for ever:</hi> He will be the ſame to you that he hath been to them. <hi>You have not yet reſiſted unto blood;</hi> but how ſoon you may be called forth unto it, is with him in whoſe hand are all our times. The Churches of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in <hi>Judaea</hi> had ſtood when the Apoſtle ſo wrote to them much what about the ſame time that you have been in the fellowſhip and order of the Goſpel. And as they then might and did ſee a day of National Calamity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, <hi>Heb. 10.25.</hi> ſo may you diſcern black &amp; threatning Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks Wherefore <hi>forſake not the aſſembling of your ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is, but exhort &amp; incourage one another</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:96313:4"/>
it, and <hi>that ſo much the more as you ſee the day approaching, lift up the Hands that hang down, let the feeble Knees be ſtrengthened, and make ſtreight paths for your feet, leſt that which is lame be turned out of the way, but let it rather be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Follow Peace with all men, and Holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord; looking diligently, leſt any man fail of the Grace of God, leſt any root of bitterneſs ſpringing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For ye are not come unto the Mount that might be touched,</hi> ye are not under the old dark legal Diſpenſation, which was full of terror; <hi>but you are come to Mount Sion, and to the City of the living God:</hi> you are under a far more glorious Goſpel Diſpenſation, and have in theſe Diſcourſes the Goſpel and ſpiritual Glory of that old Diſpenſation ſhining out upon you; the veil being taken off from it by the Miniſtry of this Servant of Chriſt for your ſakes. For what your Miniſters are, they are for you. <hi>Epaphras</hi> was a faithful Miniſter of Chriſt for the Church at <hi>Coloſs.</hi> This Author was inlightned by Chriſt for you. The influences that the Miniſters are the Subjects of, are for their people. If their Conſolation abound thrô Chriſt, it is that they may be able to comfort others with the Comforts wherewith they themſelves are comforted of God, <hi>2 Cor. 1.4, 6.</hi> If they be enabled to walk exemplarily in Goſpel-ſimplicity, holineſs, juſtneſs and unblamableneſs through variety of ſingular and ſore tryals, it is for your ſakes, <hi>1 Theſſ. 1.5.</hi> with chap. <hi>2.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10.</hi> their Light and Gifts are yours, and for you, <hi>1 Cor. 3.22.</hi> Theſe Sermons in the preaching of them were in a peculiar manner for you: ſo are they now in this making of them yet more publick. So are thoſe that now labour among you in the Word and Doctrine your Servants for Chriſts ſake. The Bleſſing of Heaven go along with both this Book and their Labours. <hi>Amen.</hi> And let every one alſo that reads, ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Hebrews 4.2.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                     <p>For unto us was the Goſpel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</p>
                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THE ſcope of this Epiſtle is to perſwade them to perſevere in their Chriſtian profeſſion, and not to fall off to Judaiſm, from the Goſpel to the Law.</p>
               <p>To this end he ſets before them the excellency of the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Law, the excellency of <hi>Chriſt</hi> above <hi>Moſes.</hi> In the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96313:6"/>
whereof he inſerts many wholeſom exhortations and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe former truths and diſpenſations of old to us in Goſpel times: And having from <hi>Pſalm</hi> the 95th. ſpoken of their being ſhut out of Gods reſt, becauſe of their Unbelief, in cap. 3.18. <hi>And to whom ſware he that they ſhould not enter into his reſt, but to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not?</hi> he applies this cap. 4.1. <hi>Let us therefore fear, leaſt a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe being left us of entring into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it:</hi> And inforceth this caution by paralelling their ſtate with ours in the words of the Text. <hi>For unto us was the Goſpel preached as well as unto them:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee how the Text comes in as an inforcement of that exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, take heed of falling ſhort of entring into reſt, ſeeing the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is preached unto us as it was unto them, and it became unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto them, becauſe they did not take heed of that ſin which is here dehorted from, even the ſin of Unbelief.</p>
               <p>In the words are three Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Goſpel was preached both under the Old and New Teſtament; to them as well as to us; to us as well as them. The Apoſtle joins theſe together, unto us as well as unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there be ſome, who though they hear the Goſpel, yet do not profit by it: they are but high-way ground, ſtony ground, thorny ground hearers, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>The word may be preached to many that live under the clear and powerful diſpenſations of the Goſpel, yet they not profit by it. There is but one ſort of good ground, of fruitful hearers: many there are to whom the Goſpel is preached, but they hear it unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and unprofitably.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the main cauſe of this unprofitableneſs under the Goſpel is becauſe of their Unbelief. The reaſon of unfruitfulneſs and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs under the preaching of the Goſpel, is for want of Faith in them that hear it. <hi>The word did not profit them, not being mixed with faith.</hi> Unbelief is the cauſe of this unprofitableneſs. Many complain of their own unprofitableneſs, and many take no notice of the cauſe of it. It is for want of Faith. It is the firſt of theſe three that I deſign to ſpeak unto, the Lord aſſiſting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96313:6"/>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. That the Goſpel was preached to them under the Old Teſtament, as well as to us under the New. I put it ſo, as beſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the ſcope I intend.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle here ſuppoſeth it as a known and granted truth, that they had the Goſpel; and he adds, that we have it too, as well as they: But that they had it, he ſuppoſeth it as a thing beyond all queſtion; as a thing received, and believed, and underſtood amongſt them, and that needed no diſpute. <hi>For unto us was the Goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well as unto them.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, no doubt it was preach'd to them, and ſo it is to us alſo. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>And the Scripture foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the Heathen through Faith, preached before the Goſpel unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>ſaying, in thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Goſpel is the glad tidings of Man's Recovery by Jeſus Chriſt, out of the ſtate of Sin and Death into which he was fallen, into a ſtate of Favour and Communion with God again; into a ſtate of Life and Happineſs. Now this was made known to them of old; theſe glad tidings ſounded in their ears, as well as ours. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.15. <hi>Bleſſed are the people that hear the joyful ſound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſons for the proof of it may be ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe they had the ſame Goſpel bleſſings and mercies promiſed, preached, and revealed unto them that we have now, that are revealed and made known unto us; and in the ſame way, and upon the ſame account as we have them now.</p>
               <p>There be two Branches of this Argument.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That they had the ſame Goſpel mercies preached and held forth, and this</item>
                  <item>2. In the ſame way, and upon the ſame account.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. They had the very ſame Goſpel bleſſings and mercies that we have in theſe latter days. This will be eaſily made out and appear, if we enquire what the good things of the Goſpel are, we ſhall find that they were exhibited unto them, as well as unto us. And what are they?</p>
               <p>In general, That God would be their God. How oft is this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to them? and ſo he is to us.</p>
               <p>Now this includes three things. 1. Regeneration. 2. Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and Remiſſion of Sins. 3. Everlaſting Salvation.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96313:7"/>I. Regeneration, or the New Heart, the Heart of Fleſh, the writing of Gods Law in the heart. You know moſt of theſe are Old Teſtament phraſes. Jer. 31.33. <hi>I will put my Law in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> This was preached and held forth to them by that Seal of Circumciſion. Deut. 30.6. <hi>And the Lord thy God will circumciſe thine heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul, that thou mayeſt live:</hi> and by all their legal waſhings and purifications, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified their cleanſing from ſin; from the filth and power, as well as from the guilt of it. Ezek. 36.25, 26, 27. <hi>Then will I ſprinkle clean water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean: from all your filthineſs, and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you. A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you: and I will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh. And I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgments and do them.</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the whole frame of Saving Grace, a new diſpoſition in the heart, new principles, new walkings: This ſucceeds the Old man, corrupt Nature: this is one great Goſpel bleſſing common to them with us.</p>
               <p n="2">II. A ſecond great bleſſing of the Goſpel is Reconciliation and Remiſſion of ſins. Iſai. 1.18. <hi>Come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord, though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow; though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wooll.</hi> Jer. 33.34. <hi>I will forgive their iniquities, and I will remember their ſins no more.</hi> And innumerable more promiſes they had of this throughout the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>This part of the Goſpel was preached and ſhadowed forth to them by all their Sacrifices and Oblations, which are thefore ſaid to make atonement for them: It is a phraſe often uſed in the nine firſt Chapters of <hi>Leviticus, He that ſinned, ſhall bring ſuch or ſuch an Offering: and the Prieſt ſhall make atonement for him concerning his ſin, and it ſhall be forgiven him:</hi> Levit. 5.6. <hi>He ſhall bring his Treſpaſs-Offering unto the Lord for the ſin which he hath ſinned,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the Prieſt ſhall make an atonement for him concerning his ſin:</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:96313:7"/>
and ver. 10. <hi>He ſhall offer a Burnt-Offering according to the manner, and the Prieſt ſhall make an atonement for him for his ſin which he had ſinned, and it ſhall be forgiven him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is that we find the Saints under the Old Teſtament were ſo full of confidence and holy boldneſs in ſeeking and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God for pardon and forgiveneſs of ſin: As we ſee in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and other Scripture-Prayers, what ſtrong and eminent actings of Faith they had this way: Which to expect had been a preſumptuous thing, if they had had no promiſe to ground their Faith upon: But they had very plentiful aſſurances and promiſes of it in thoſe times: and that is a ſecond Goſpel-bleſſing revealed and aſſured to them, as well as to us; the remiſſion of all their ſins.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Everlaſting life and ſalvation in Heaven. This is not a truth revealed only by the Goſpel, but was well known, clearly revealed, and firmly believed by the Saints of old: They had aſſurance of this that they ſhould live with God for ever in Glory. <hi>When I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy likeneſs.</hi> Pſal. 17.15. <hi>Thou wilt guide me with thy counſel, and afterwards receive me to glory.</hi> Pſal. 73.24. <hi>In thy preſence is fulneſs of joy, and at thy right hand there are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> Pſalm 16.11. They looked for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country, whereof <hi>Canaan</hi> was but a Type and Shadow, as the Apoſtle ſhews in this Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> cap. 11.16. They knew there was an eternal State of Happineſs for the Saints, as well as an eternal State of Miſery for the Wicked; they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this in thoſe days.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee they had the ſame Goſpel-bleſſings preached unto them of old, that we have at this day: and theſe bleſſings and good things are demonſtrations that it was Goſpel, becauſe theſe bleſſings are not promiſed in the Law. It knows no remiſſion, or regeneration of a loſt Soul, no ſalvation of a Sinner. This was the firſt branch of the Argument; But for a more clear and full eviction of it, the ſecond part of the Argument was this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe they had theſe bleſſings upon the ſame account, and in the ſame way as we have them now; I ſpeak as to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and internal cauſes of them. For in the outward way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96313:8"/>
of diſpenſation, there was a difference, but not in this. For upon what account have we theſe precious benefits and good things of the Goſpel? you will find, if you conſider it aright, that it was then, as now. We receive all from the meer mercy and free grace of God in Chriſt; and this was the fountain of their ſupplies alſo: If they had received pardon of Sin, and Grace, and Glory, on the account of their own merits and works of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, then it had not been Goſpel; But they had it in the ſame way we have it, as to the internal cauſe from whence all bleſſings come; even from the Mercy and Free Grace of God; a very glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Attribute of God, and moſt abundantly, yea continually held forth throughout the Old Teſtament: <hi>That he is the Lord, the Lord God, gracious and merciful.</hi> How many Prayers, and Pſalms, and Songs of Praiſe unto him, <hi>for that his mercy endureth for ever:</hi> How ſweetly, how pathetically do the Prophets teach and preach it to them? this all the Saints of old had recourſe unto. <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51.1. when ſeeking pardon, <hi>Have mercy,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>upon me, O God, according to thy loving kindneſs: according to the multitude of thy mercies blot out my tranſgreſſions?</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> 9.8, 9. when he beſought the Lord on behalf of the <hi>Jews, O Lord, to us belongeth confuſion of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c. becauſe we have ſinned againſt thee: To the Lord our God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long mercies and forgiveneſſes, though we have rebelled againſt him.</hi> We do not preſent our ſupplications before thee for our righteouſneſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; but <hi>for thy great mercies,</hi> ver. 18. and <hi>for thine own ſake,</hi> ver. 19. This then was that they had recourſe unto, as the Fountain of all the good whereof they ſtood in need, and of all their ſupplies, even the infinite mercies of God. Moreover it was the mercies of God in Chriſt, his mercies through the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt. For only through him is mercy communicated to Sinners, ſo alone is mercy communicated: Therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> there prays, Dan. 9.17. <hi>Look upon thy Sanctuary that is deſolate, for the Lords ſake,</hi> that is, for the Lord Jeſus Chriſts ſake.</p>
               <p>Hence they did ſo often make mention of <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> (as being the Types of Chriſt) in their Prayers, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of <hi>David, For thy ſervant</hi> Davids <hi>ſake,</hi> Pſal. 89. not as reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>David</hi> litterally; but looking beyond the ſhadow, unto him
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96313:8"/>
that was the truth thereof; for by <hi>David</hi> they meant Chriſt: Chriſt is oft called by that name, becauſe <hi>David</hi> was ſo eminent a Type of him.</p>
               <p>And what is it in Chriſt that procures all theſe bleſſings in the Goſpel for us? It is his Blood and Satisfaction that atones Juſtice; his Prayers and Interceſſion that prevails with mercy for us; and ſo it was of old: both theſe had an influence into their mercies, as well as ours.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The death and blood and ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt. This all their Sacrifices pointed at. <hi>For it was impoſſible that the blood of Bulls and Goats ſhould take away ſins.</hi> Heb. 10.4. <hi>Yet it ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the purifying of the fleſh: How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 9.13, 14. See how clearly the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> preacheth this. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. throughout the Chapter, but look eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to ver. 10. <hi>When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his days: and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.</hi> This was the myſtery of all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices wherein blood was ſhed: they were Types and Shadows of the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Prayers and Interceſſions. For, look, as mercy is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by the merit of his Death, ſo it is communicated and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied through the vertue of his Interceſſion: Juſtice is ſatisfied by his Death, and mercy intreated in his Interceſſion, and ſo both thoſe great Attributes are acknowledged and glorified in Zach. 1.12. <hi>Then the Angel of the Lord,</hi> that is, Jeſus Chriſt the Angel of the Covenant that appeared, he <hi>anſwered and ſaid, how long wilt thou not have mercy on</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and on the Cities of</hi> Judah, <hi>againſt which thou haſt had indignation theſe threeſcore and ten years! And the Lord anſwered the Angel that talked with me, with good words and with comfortable words.</hi> ver. 13. here the prevailing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Interceſſion is ſet forth.</p>
               <p>And as the merit of his Blood was ſhadowed by the Sacrifices; ſo the efficacy of his Interceſſion was ſhadowed forth by the Incenſe and ſweet Odours offered up to God under the Law. Theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Prayers of Jeſus Chriſt; he offers Incenſe with the Prayers of the Saints. Revel. 8.3, 4. <hi>And another Angel came and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96313:9"/>
ſtood at the Altar, having a Golden Cenſer; and there was given unto him much Incenſe, that he ſhould offer it with the prayers of all Saints upon the Golden Altar which was before the Throne. And the ſmoke of the Incenſe which came with the prayers of the Saints, aſcended up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God out of the Angels hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had therefore both the ſame Goſpel-bleſſings, and upon the ſame Goſpel account, as we, namely, from the meer mercy of God, through the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, through his Death and Interceſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. A ſecond Argument might be taken from an Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Induction of all thoſe former times, and the ſeveral Goſpel Diſcoveries which the Lord vouchſafed to them all along from time to time.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe after his Fall. The Goſpel was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him in that great and bleſſed Promiſe, that <hi>the ſeed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpents head.</hi> This was the firſt Goſpel Sermon that ever was preached.</p>
               <p>Afterwards to <hi>Abraham</hi> the Goſpel was preached, Gal. 3.8. when it was promiſed that <hi>in thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the World be bleſſed— and in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when the Lord ſaid, <hi>I am the Lord thy God that brought thee forth out of the Land of</hi> Egypt: For he was a Typical Mediator.</p>
               <p>There were yet further Diſcoveries in <hi>Davids</hi> time: Chriſt is the true <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I might go through the whole Old Teſtament, and ſhew you how the Lord from time to time made further and further diſcoveries of himſelf to his people in ſucceeding ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Either the Goſpel was preached unto them of old, or elſe it will follow, that they were all damned, or elſe that they were ſaved without Chriſt; which to imagine were infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory and diſhonorable to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Fathers before the coming of Chriſt were ſaved and went to Heaven.</p>
               <p>But without Chriſt there is no ſalvation. <hi>For there is no other name under heaven &amp;c.</hi> Acts 4.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:96313:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>It is impoſſible that any Sinner ſhould be ſaved without Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qui ſalutem cuiquam promittit ſine Chriſto, neſcio an ille ſalutem habere poteſt in Chriſto, Auſtin.</hi> He that promiſeth any man Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation without Chriſt, I know not whether he can have Salvation by Chriſt. <hi>By the works of the Law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified</hi> or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Rom. 3.20. Gal. 2.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt therefore is the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13.8. that is, in all times and ages: and ſo we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it thus. Yeſterday under the Law, to day under the Goſpel, and for ever Jeſus Chriſt is the only Saviour. Therefore if the Old Teſtament Saints were ſaved, it was by Chriſt, and if by Chriſt, they had the Goſpel preached to them as well as we.</p>
               <p>So we ſee the Truth of the Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. But why do we call it the Old Teſtament, if it was Goſpel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is only in regard of the manner of Diſpenſation: we do not call the firſt part of the Bible, or the times wherein it was written, <hi>the Old Teſtament;</hi> and the latter part of the Bible, and the the times wherein it was written, <hi>the new Teſtament,</hi> as if the former were meer <hi>Law,</hi> and the latter nothing but <hi>Goſpel.</hi> No, therefore take heed of miſtaking here. For there is very much of the Goſpel, and the Grace of God in Chriſt revealed in the Old Teſtament; many precious Goſpel truths in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: And there is very much of the Law and threatnings thereof declared, written down and left upon Record to us in the New Teſtament. Yea there is more of Hell and Damnation, there are more dreadful threatnings thereof in the Sermons of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt recorded in the four Evangeliſts, than is to be found in all the Old Teſtament: But we call it the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe it was the firſt Diſpenſation of the Goſpel: And the Goſpel we call the New Teſtament, becauſe it is the new Diſpenſation of the ſame everlaſting Goſpel; therefore the reaſon is only in the way and manner of their Diſpenſation, and not in the Subjects themſelves.</p>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. But there is a ſecond Objection that the Apoſtle often ſpeaks of, <hi>That ancient Diſpenſation;</hi> as if it was Law, and not Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96313:10"/>
Some Scriptures call <hi>that Old Teſtament Adminiſtration Law, the Miniſtration of Death. as</hi> John 1.17. <hi>the Law came by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace and Truth by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If it was Law, (may ſome ſay) then it was not Goſpel: ſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. <hi>the Miniſtration of Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We muſt diſtinguiſh between the thing preached, and the manner of Preaching, between the Shell, and the Kernel, the Shadow, and the Subſtance.</p>
               <p>Now the thing preached was the Goſpel, though the manner of preaching it was legal; the Kernel was Goſpel, though the Shell was Law: The Spirit and Subſtance, and Myſtery of that Diſpenſation was Evangelical, though it was involved in a legal Shell and outſide, and overſhadowed with the Shades and Figures of the Law. God never had but one way only to ſave men by, but it had divers faſhions and forms, divers outward diſcoveries and manifeſtations; in thoſe times in a more legal manner, but afterwards more like it ſelf, in a more evangelical manner.</p>
               <p>This Legality of that Adminiſtration appears chiefly in five things, which were the peculiar Properties and Characters of that Diſpenſation, by which it is diſtinguiſhed from the Goſpel-diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, as being much inferiour to it. So we ſhall ſhew you two things at once, both the differences of the two Adminiſtrations, and withal the Preheminence and Excellencies of the New above the Old. <hi>It was dark, weak, carnal, burthenſome, and terrible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It was dark, but the Goſpel is clear: all things were involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thick and dark Shadows. Though there was a Light in that Moſaical Paedagogy, which did appear and ſhine forth into the minds of Gods Elect, yet withal there was a cloud of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as to the outward Adminiſtration, eſpecially if compared with the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel ſince the coming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There was and is a double uſe of Types and Parables, and of that whole way of Argument by Similitude and Compariſons: they do both darken and illuſtrate; if explained and underſtood, they do exceedingly enlighten and illuſtrate; but if not explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are like a Riddle, they caſt a dark miſt and cloud upon the thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:96313:10"/>So was the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to all thoſe that were not inſtructed by the Spirit to underſtand the Myſtery of it. The Reaſon and Meaning of it was hidden to the moſt of them; hence a Veil is ſaid to be upon their Hearts, that they could not ſee to the end of that which is aboliſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13, 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle there diſcourſeth it at large.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was weak, but the Goſpel is powerful, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. therefore that is called the Letter, this the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There was much of external Pomp and Splendor, but little of that Power and Spirituality that is in Goſpel-worſhip, which though very pleaſing to the people, yet upon this account partly the Apoſtle calls them <hi>carnal Ordinances</hi> Heb. 9.10. and <hi>a worldly Sanctuary,</hi> ver. 1. becauſe they conſiſted ſo much in outward, low, ſenſible things, ſo ſuitable to the reliſh, and deſire, and diſpoſition of a carnal Heart.</p>
               <p>Therefore the carnal Jews were very tenacious of theſe exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of <hi>Moſes,</hi> though deſperately averſe to the things themſelves included and intended in them.</p>
               <p>Chriſt oppoſeth their local Worſhip to ſpiritual Worſhip, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.21, 23. implying that that was not ſo ſpiritual as Goſpel-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>The carnal Jews did turn it into meer Law and Works by their abuſe and miſunderſtanding of it. As the Phariſees; how did they truſt in outward Works, and expected Salvation by their own Righteouſneſs? they reſted and ſate down in the Shell and outſide of things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. <hi>As it were by the Works of the Law.</hi> For they had no real legal Perfection in them; but only in their own proud and falſe conceit they thought the bringing of a Sacrafice was that, that did expiate Sin, and merit and deſerve Acceptance with God: They did not look beyond all, to the meer Mercy and free Grace of God in Chriſt; they did not look to the end of things, to the time of Reformation that was to come, and ſo they ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the ſtumbling ſtone.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It was a burthenſome Diſpenſation, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. <hi>a Yoke which neither our Fathers, nor we, were able to bear.</hi> They were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable Yoke, an intolerable Burthen, both as to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96313:11"/>
and nature: They had a great number of external Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from all which the Goſpel hath ſet us free.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The manner of Adminiſtration was legal, in regard of the Bondage and Terror of it. It left impreſſions of terror upon their ſpirits.</p>
               <p>God appeared in ſuch dreadful Majeſty unto them on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> as it ſhook the Mountain, and ſhook all their Hearts ſo terrible, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>I exceedingly fear and quake,</hi> Heb. 12.10, 18, 21. ſo terrible to all the people, that <hi>they wiſhed that God would never ſpeak unto them immediately any more:</hi> ſo the Lord gave an Interpreter to reveal and ſpeak the Mind of God unto them; and ſo it hath been ever ſince.</p>
               <p>Hence was that Speech of <hi>Auſtin. Breuis differentia Legis &amp; Evangelii timor &amp; amor,</hi> the difference between Law and Goſpel in brief is Fear and Love.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the Doctrine cleared up, and ſo much ſhall ſerve for the clearing up this Truth, and removing theſe Objections againſt it.</p>
               <p>We ſhall conclude with two or three words of Uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Incouragement to ſtudy the Old Teſtament; and the Types and Shadows of the Law. Is it ſo that the Goſpel was preached to them under the Old Teſtament, as well as to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New? We ſee then the uſefulneſs of the Old Teſtament to New-Teſtament Saints: we ſee what uſe there is of ſearching into theſe ancient Diſpenſations. Will you ſearch into the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Goſpel? then conſider how God inſtructed and taught them of old. There are ſome Goſpel Truths more expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and mentioned to them of old, than to us, as that of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore let us ſearch into thoſe ancient Adminiſtrations, becauſe there is much Goſpel there; though the Shell be hard, yet there is excellent ſubſtance in the Kernel.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Direction how to attain to the underſtanding of thoſe Myſteries, ſtudy the Goſpel. For it was Goſpel that was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them. <hi>Faedus gratiae clavis totius Scripturae.</hi>

Many, coming to read Chapters in the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Law, are apt to think, this is a ſealed Book, we are not to bring theſe Offerings to God now, we know not what uſe to make of it: many Chriſtians make no more uſe of them, than of Apocrypha. This may ſhew us our ignorance. For there is no part of the Scripture but is of uſe; we might ſee much of God, and of the Goſpel in them, if we had skill to ſearch out the meaning and myſtery of them. <hi>But we have not the underſtanding of the holy.</hi> Poor, dark, ignorant Creatures we are, the Lord knows. <hi>Quantum eſt quod neſcimus!</hi>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. Incouragement to believe and receive the Goſpel: for it is the everlaſting Goſpel. This uſe is the direct ſcope of this Text, they had a promiſe of entring into reſt, but came ſhort of it through unbelief. <hi>Take we heed therefore of unbelief, leaſt we enter not into reſt: For the Goſpel is preached to us as well as to them.</hi> There is ground of encouragement to believe the Goſpel, to embrace and cloſe with it; for it is that which all the Saints of God both under the Old and New Teſtament have ventured their Souls upon. The Goſpel was preached to them as well as to us, and to us, as well as unto them. Thou maiſt ſafely venture thy Soul in that way where in ſo many Saints in all ages are gone to Heaven: Let us take heed leſt we fall ſhort by unbelief; <hi>for the Goſpel was preached to us, as well as unto them; but the Word profited them not, becauſe it was not mixed with Faith in them that heard it. Take heed, having the Promiſes of entring into reſt, leſt any of you fall ſhort:</hi> take heed of falling ſhort of the good things of the Goſpel, of that Reſt which the Goſpel gives to ſinful, guilty, weary Souls. Is ſuch a Goſpel preached, and ſuch glad tydings revealed, and wilt not thou cloſe with them, and receive them gladly and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully?</p>
               <p>All the Goſpel Diſpenſations in the Book of God will riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, if thou art an Unbeliever; all the Saints of old will judge thee, and teſtifie againſt thee. They had but a little glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering Light, yet they ventured all upon that. But now the Sun appears and ſhines on the World in Clearneſs and Glory. They might have objected, that the height of Goſpel-light is not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96313:12"/>
which might be great hinderance to them; therefore if God was angry with them then, how much more with us now, how ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation? If every word ſpoken then was ſtedfaſt, and was ſufficient to bring Souls out of the ſtate of Sin and Death, to Happineſs; how much more the Word and Light that we enjoy? <hi>For if the Word ſpoken by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels was ſtedfaſt, and every Tranſgreſſion and Diſobedience received a juſt recompence of Reward,</hi> Heb. 2.2, 3. <hi>how ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation?</hi> Unbelief is a damning Sin in all ages; but the more clearly the Goſpel is preached, the more inexcuſable is the Unbelief of ſinners that periſh in their ſins; the more inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable is their Sin, and the more deep and dreadful will their Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be. The Apoſtle calls the Goſpel the Word of Truth, Unbelief ſaith it is a Lye. It gives God the lye, it makes him a Lyer, and makes the Goſpel a Fable. If there be a way of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, why ſhouldſt not thou believe and venture thy Soul on that; if there be no ſuch way, then the Goſpel is a Lye, and wilt thou ſay the Goſpel is a lye? We have a proverb, <hi>as ſure as Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> There is nothing ſo clear, and ſure, and certain, as the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. All Happineſs depends on the believing of the Goſpel. Therefore take heed of, and ſtrive againſt Unbelief, labour as much againſt it as againſt any other Corruption: and the chief help is a clear underſtanding, a clear inſight and underſtanding in the Myſtery of the Goſpel, this will help againſt all thy Unbelief; then all thy Objections will vaniſh as Darkneſs before the Sun. It's Ignorance of the Goſpel from whence ſo many Objections ariſe: Beg of God to give thee clear Goſpel-Light, and this will be the beſt means to overcome and overpower that ſin of Unbelief. Did men ſee the Excellency, the Truth and Goodneſs of the Goſpel; they would receive it gladly and thankfully. The Goſpel is both true tydings and glad tydings, it's both true and glad tydings. Now were this believed, it would chear up the Hearts of poor Sinners.</p>

               <p>The ſcope of the words is to compare and prefer the Goſpel Diſcoveries and manifeſtations of God, before the Legal, which he doth by a moſt elegant Antitheſis between them: <hi>Then</hi> God ſpake <hi>to the Fathers, now to us;</hi> that was <hi>by the Prophets,</hi> but now <hi>by his Son: Thoſe</hi> Diſcoveries were <hi>of old,</hi> and ſo are paſſed away, but the Goſpel is <hi>in theſe laſt days;</hi> And finally, <hi>then</hi> he ſpake <hi>in divers manners, and at ſundry times.

               </p>
               <p>We may reſolve the Text into four general Propoſitions or points of Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it hath pleaſed God to ſpeak or reveal Himſelf, and his Mind, and Will, unto poor loſt Man, in order to his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Salvation. For he ſpeaketh here only of the Goſpel Diſcoveries.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there be two grand Diſcoveries or Diſpenſations of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96313:13"/>
Mind of God unto the Sons of Men; the one before, the other ſince the coming of his Son.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That under that former Diſpenſation God did reveal and ſpeak his Mind of old unto the Fathers by the Prophets in divers manners, and at ſundry times.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That in this laſt Diſpenſation, inſtead of all thoſe former various Diſcoveries uſed of old, he hath ſpoken his Mind unto us only by his Son.</p>
               <p>You ſee the two laſt Doctrines do contain and hold forth the Differences and peculiar Characters of each Diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>It is only the third Doctrine that we are now to ſpeak unto, <hi>viz.</hi> that under the old Diſpenſation God did reveal and ſpeak his Mind unto the Fathers by the Prophets in divers manners, and at ſundry times.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was of old; therefore now paſſed away, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.13. <hi>that which decayeth, and waxeth old, is ready to vaniſh.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The Lord was pleaſed herein to uſe great variety; he did not limit and confine himſelf to one way and manner of Diſcovery; but he ſpake ſometimes in one manner and ſometimes in another. It concerns us to enquire into it, ſo far as we have Scripture-light
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96313:13"/>
to guide us. For <hi>we are built upon the Foundations of the Prophets and Apoſtles.</hi> Epheſ. 2.20. Yet we muſt do it with Sobriety of Spirit, eſchewing and taking heed of vain Curioſity. For they themſelves who received thoſe extraordinary Manifeſtations did not always fully know the manner of them in all circumſtances: as <hi>the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>himſelf knew not whether in the Body, or out of the Body.</hi> 2 Cor. 12.</p>
               <p>This is one of the great things God doth, which we cannot comprehend, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Job.</hi> 37.5.</p>

               <p>Theſe divers manners therefore of Gods ſpeaking or revealing his Mind of old, may be referred chiefly to theſe ſeven Heads.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The Lord was wonted then to ſpeak by Viſions, I mean viſible Apparitions and Repreſentations of things to the eye; the perſon being awake and not aſleep. I do not mean things repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented meerly to the Mind and inward Thoughts; for this will come in afterwards under another head, namely, that of inward Inſpiration and Revelation; but I ſpeak now of ſuch Viſions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in things were really and indeed objected to the outward Senſes.

               <p>It ſeemeth by the expreſſions, <hi>Deum humanâ effigie pertranfijſſe;</hi> that God paſſed by in an humane ſhape.</p>
               <p>All the three Perſons of the Trinity have appeared diſtinctly in viſible Repreſentations.</p>
               <p>God the Father and the Son. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9 — 13. <hi>I beheld till the Thrones were caſt down, and the ancient of days did ſit; — I ſaw in the night Viſions; and behold one like the Son of Man came with the Clouds of Heaven to the ancient of days</hi> — Revel. 4.1. compared with Chap. 5.7. where we find that <hi>the Lamb took the Book out of the right hand of him that ſat upon the Throne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that here be two of thoſe glorious Perſons diſtinctly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Above the Firmament there was the likeneſs of a Throne, and upon it the likeneſs as the appearance of a Man about it</hi> — It ſeems to be meant of God the Father, becauſe <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.2, 4. He is diſtinguiſhed from the Man with a Writers Inkhorn by his ſide, who is thought to be our only High Prieſt the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Perſon Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 3.2, 4. For he is called <hi>the Angel,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees not ſo well to the firſt Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>prays for his Good will,</hi> Deut. 33.16.</p>
               <p>Therefore it was not any created Angel, but Jeſus Chriſt the Angel of the Covenant of Grace; as a <hi>praeludium</hi> to his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:96313:14"/>So to <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 6.1. <hi>he ſaw the Lord.</hi> It is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſo it is interpreted, <hi>John</hi> 12.41.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24. <hi>And Jacob was left alone, and there wreſtled a Man with him until the breaking of the day;</hi> that is, God in the form of a Man, as the old <hi>Geneva</hi> Note hath it. The Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſaith, it was God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.3, 4. <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>wept and made ſupplication unto him, and there he,</hi> or God, <hi>ſpake with us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Perſon, the Holy Ghoſt in the ſhape of a Dove at the Baptiſm of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes Angels have appeared, ſometimes in Bodies of humane ſhape, provided for them by the Power of God, either created of nothing, and after the Apparition annihilated; or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted of the four Elements, and eſpecially of Air condenſed, and then reſolved again, after the Appearance was paſt, into the matter of which they were compounded.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Lot,</hi> Gen. 19.1, 10. <hi>And there came two Angels to</hi> Sodom, <hi>and</hi> Lot <hi>ſeeing them roſe up to meet them, and bowed himſelf with his Face to the ground.</hi> Theſe Angels verſ. 10. are called Men.</p>
               <p>To <hi>David,</hi> 2. Sam. 24.17. <hi>And</hi> David <hi>ſpake unto the Lord, when he ſaw the Angel that ſmote the People, and ſaid, Lo, I have ſinned, and I have done wickedly</hi> &amp;c. He ſaw the Angel. Which is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explained, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.16. <hi>And</hi> David <hi>lift up his eyes, and ſaw the Angel of the Lord ſtand between the Earth and the Heaven with a drawn Sword in his hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At Chriſts Reſurrection divers Angels appeared in the ſhapes of Men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.2, 3. <hi>An Angel rolled back the Stone from the door of the Sepulchre, and ſate upon it,</hi> &amp;c. Luke 24.4. <hi>Behold two Men ſtood by them in ſhining Raiment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So at his Aſcenſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.10. <hi>Behold two Men ſtood by them in white Apparel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes the Angels did appear not only in humane ſhapes, but with other Repreſentations accompanying them: as Horſes and Chariots of Fire, that is, with Riders upon them. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.17. <hi>Behold, the Mountain was full of Horſes and Chariots of Fire round about</hi> Eliſha. Zach. 1.8. <hi>Behold a Man riding upon a red Horſe, and behind him there were red Horſes ſpeckled and white</hi> —
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96313:15"/>
and 6.1. <hi>there came four Chariots out from between the two Mountains.</hi> ver. 5. <hi>Theſe are the four Spirits of the Heavens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes other things were repreſented and ſhewn in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to them, to ſignifie to them the Mind of God: as <hi>Jerem.</hi> 1.11, 13. <hi>The Prophet there ſeeth the Rod of an Almond tree, and a ſeething pot, with the face thereof toward the North</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Amos</hi> cap. 7. ver. 1, 4, 7, 8. has ſeveral things preſented in Viſion to him.</p>
               <p>And this is one of theſe divers manners of the Lords ſpeaking, <hi>viz.</hi> by Viſions, or Repreſentations to the eye waking.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another manner was by Dreams, that is, by Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things to the Fancy in ſleep: and they had not only things preſented, but uſually Words ſpoken, to interpret them.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the Lord gave divine Dreams to wicked men; as to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> but they knew not what they meant, and ſo were not Prophets; but the Lord ſent the Interpretation by others, who were his faithful Servants. But the Prophets and Servants of God uſually had both the Dream, and ſome further light for the Perception and Interpretation of it.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 15.12. <hi>And when the Sun was going down, a deep ſleep fell upon</hi> Abram, <hi>and lo, an horrour of great Darkneſs fell upon him, and he ſaid unto</hi> Abram, <hi>know of a ſurety,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 13.</p>
               <p>And to <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 28.12, 13. the Dream of the Ladder, ver. 12. is interpreted to him by God in the following verſes, and 31.11, 12. <hi>The Angel of the Lord appeared to</hi> Jacob <hi>in a Dream, and ſpeaks unto him:</hi> and 46.2. <hi>God ſpake unto</hi> Iſrael <hi>in the Viſions of the night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So to <hi>Daniel,</hi> cap. 7. 1, 7, 13. the divers night Viſions he had there are afterwards interpreted to him, ver. 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Matth. 1.20. <hi>An Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a Dream, ſaying, fear not to take unto thee</hi> Mary <hi>thy Wife:</hi> and Matth. 2.13, 19. <hi>An Angel of the Lord appeareth in a Dream to him, ſaying, ariſe, and take the young Child and his Mother, and go into the Land of</hi> Iſrael. This way and manner of ſpeaking ſeems to have been very frequent and uſual in thoſe ancient times: as thoſe words of <hi>Elihu</hi> intimate, <hi>Job.</hi> 33.14, 15, 16. <hi>For God ſpeaketh
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96313:15"/>
once, yea twice, in a Dream, in a Viſion of the night,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Aynſworth</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.3. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.5.</note> 
                  <hi>when deep ſleep falleth upon Men, in ſlumbers upon the bed, then he openeth the Ears of Men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third manner was by Voices, by an audible Voice uttered either by God himſelf immediately, or the Angels.</p>
               <p>And theſe audible Voices are accompanied ſometimes with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Appearances to the eye; but ſometimes the Voice alone without any viſible apparition.</p>
               <p>To our <hi>firſt Parents,</hi> Gen. 3.3. It was <hi>the Voice of God,</hi> and not of an Angel. For he ſaith, <hi>the Tree which I commanded</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But the moſt famous Inſtance hereof was at the giving of the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai, Exod</hi> 19, and 20. where <hi>the Lord ſpake with an audible Voice from Heaven:</hi> chap. 19. 9, 20. <hi>ſo that the People might hear;</hi> and chap. 20. 22. <hi>and ſee, that the Lord talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them from Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.22, 23, 24. <hi>Theſe words the Lord ſpake unto all your Aſſembly in the Mount, out of the midſt of the Fire, of the Cloud, and of the thick Darkneſs, with a great Voice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when ye heard the Voice</hi> —</p>
               <p>Heb. 12.26. <hi>Whoſe Voice then ſhook the Earth:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Matth. 17.5. <hi>A Voice out of the Cloud ſaid, this is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son</hi> —</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But they ſaw no ſimilitude,</hi> Deut. 4.12.</p>
               <p>1 Kings 19.12, 13. <hi>A ſtill ſmall Voice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. By an inward Inſtinct; by immediate Inſpirations and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>So to <hi>David</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.12, 19. though he had it in Writing alſo, and left it to his Son — But it was revealed to him by the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>So to <hi>Philip,</hi> Acts 8.29. <hi>The Spirit ſaid unto Philip</hi> —</p>
               <p>To <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 10.19. <hi>The Spirit ſaid unto him,</hi> and <hi>Acts.</hi> 11, 12. <hi>the Spirit bade me go with them</hi> —</p>
               <p>To <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Acts</hi> 16.7. Not to go into <hi>Bithynia; but the Spirit ſuffered them not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. By legal <hi>Types and Shadows:</hi> Theſe were ſpeaking things. And what did they ſpeak? They ſpake forth Goſpel Truths and Myſteries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:96313:16"/>The Ceremonial Law was the Goſpel in <hi>Types and Shadows.</hi> Heb. 10.1. <hi>The Law having a ſhadow of good things to come.</hi> A <hi>Type</hi> is a legal ſhadow of Goſpel Truths and Myſteries. Theſe were the ſtanding Ordinances and Inſtructions of thoſe times.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By Signs and Wonders. Theſe had a Voice, and did ſpeak the Mind of God: Theſe were atteſtations to the Truth and Mind of God, and to the Authority of the Meſſenger.</p>
               <p>See <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.8. <hi>If they will not believe thee, nor hearken to the Voice of the firſt Sign, they will believe the Voice of the latter Sign</hi>— Joh. 3.2. <hi>We know that thou art a Teacher come from God:</hi> For <hi>no man can do theſe Miracles that thou doeſt, except God be with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord may work Miracles now.</p>
               <p>But he doth not now ſend forth any perſon with a Commiſſion to do it, as he did of old.</p>
               <p n="7">7. By a ſpecial and peculiar kind of intimacy and familiarity; as it were mouth to mouth, without Parable or Riddle; without Obſcurity; with all poſſible familiarity.</p>
               <p>And this was <hi>Moſes</hi> his Priviledg, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.8. <hi>with him will I ſpeak mouth to mouth;</hi> apparently, and not in dark ſpeeches. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.11, 23. <hi>The Lord ſpake to him face to face,</hi> as a man ſpeaketh to his friend, —<hi>thou ſhalt ſee my back parts</hi>—</p>
               <p>That phraſe of ſpeaking mouth to mouth, notes the clearneſs, and certainty, and familiarity of it: as when <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaith, ye ſee it is my mouth that ſpeaketh unto you. <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.12. This was a priviledg peculiar unto <hi>Moſes.</hi> Deut. 34.10. <hi>There aroſe no Prophet like him ſince, whom the Lord knew face to face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That that comes neareſt to it ſeems to be the ineffable things that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw and heard in the third heaven. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3, 4— and the Revelation given to the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> which is the cleareſt, and yet withal the deepeſt and moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful of all the Propheſies recorded in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>There be two Queſtions may ariſe here, which would be briefly ſpoken to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Whether there were not counterfeits of theſe things, and if there were, how did they diſcern the Lords voice in theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary diſpenſations from Satans voice in his deluſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:96313:16"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, there were counterfeits of them; there were Viſons, Dreams, ſeeming Miracles, Impulſes from Satan, as well as from God. <hi>Diabolus eſt Dei ſimia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence that Caution of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 13.1.</p>
               <p>And hence are thoſe complaints of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> cap. 14. 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.22, 23. That famous Inſtance of a lying Spirit in the mouths of <hi>Ahabs</hi> Prophets.</p>
               <p>Therefore to have a Viſion, to dream ſtrange and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dreams, to have a powerful <hi>Impetus</hi> and <hi>afflatus</hi> from a Spirit, are not things ſimply peculiar to the true Prophets of God.</p>
               <p>But though <hi>Satan</hi> did, partly out of Craft, to deceive thereby the more effectually, and partly out of Blaſphemy and Malice, to put an affront as it were upon God, uſe ways and means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that had ſome reſemblance of Gods own ways and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; yet there were manifeſt and palpable differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. I ſhall name but theſe four;</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord did not uſually ſuffer <hi>Satan</hi> to transform himſelf ſo far into an Angel of Light, as to come in theſe ways unto his own people, unto ſuch as were truly Godly.</p>
               <p>Search the Scriptures, and you will not find, that <hi>Satan</hi> did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to give Satanical Dreams and Viſions, and the like, to ſuch as were Godly: It is true, he did tempt them, but in a more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner, as he tempted <hi>David</hi> to number the people.</p>
               <p>Or by other outward means: As when the young Prophet that came from <hi>Bethel</hi> was deceived by the old one.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>Satan</hi> did inſpire any with Dreams and Viſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it was done to wicked and ungodly men. As to <hi>Saul,</hi> when he raiſed up the Devil, he and and the Witch ſaw the Gods, that is, Spirits, infernal Spirits aſcending up out of the Earth.</p>
               <p>And to the falſe Prophets of <hi>Ahab,</hi> thoſe four hundred-Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; they ſpake as Prophets, and were acted by a Spirit; but it was a lying Spirit, and they were lewd and wicked men: ſo that there was a great difference in the Perſon or Subject reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient of Divine Revelations, and of Satanical Deluſions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In Divine Diſcoveries there was an holy Elevation of their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96313:17"/>
Minds when they did receive them; but in the Organs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of <hi>Satan,</hi> there was only a ſtupefaction and depreſſion of them.</p>
               <p>As when <hi>John</hi> did receive the Revelation, <hi>he was in the Spirit,</hi> chap. 1. 10.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they were ſo far elevated, and raiſed, and acted by the Spirit, that they did not attend to any other thing; but were tranſported above Senſe and ſenſible things, to attend wholly to the Viſions and Revelations of God:</p>
               <p>So <hi>Peter</hi> fell into a Trance, <hi>Acts.</hi> 10.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.17.</p>
               <p>Hence oftentimes they fell upon their Faces, being aſtoniſh'd at the Majeſty and Glory of the Lord; both gratious and natural Fear concurring— <hi>Ezek:</hi> 1.28. <hi>Dan:</hi> 10.8, 9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.6, 7.</p>
               <p>But this Raviſhment of Spirit was not a ſtupefaction, but an holy Elevation of their Minds, whereby they were taken off and lifted up above all theſe low things, to the higheſt exerciſe of Faith and ſpiritual Reaſon, and ſo better fitted and compoſed to receive thoſe Divine Irradiations and Manifeſtations of God:</p>
               <p>So <hi>Daniel</hi> 10.1. <hi>He underſtood the thing, and had underſtanding of the Viſion:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Balaam,</hi> when the Lord was pleaſed in an extraordinary caſe to act him after the manner of a true Prophet, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.4, 16. <hi>falling into a trance, but having his eyes open.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But on the contrary, ſuch as were acted by <hi>Satan,</hi> they had their extatical Furies, wherein their Minds were ſo diſcompoſed, that they were not <hi>compotes ſanae mentis.</hi> As ſome have written of the <hi>Sybils,</hi> that when after their Propheſyings, they came to themſelves again, they had forgotten what they had ſaid, and ſo could not review and correct what was written from them:</p>
               <p>But it was not ſo with the Prophets of God, <hi>John</hi> wrote, and had Order to write his <hi>Apocalypſe:</hi> and ſo the other Prophets.</p>
               <p>And when thoſe to whom, and by whom the Devil ſpake, were not diſcompoſed to ſuch a degree, even to fury and Diſtraction; yet they were always debaſed and brought down below them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Lords Prophets were raiſed above themſelves: Theſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96313:17"/>
were depreſſed even below themſelves by dealing with <hi>Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Prophets and Servants of God had an inward Seal from God of the Truth of what they ſpake. Not unlike that <hi>new Name in the white Stone, which none could read but he that had it.</hi> Revel. 2.17. Jer. 11.18. — <hi>They believed, and therefore ſpake.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. See <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.6. <hi>My people ſhall know that I am he that doth ſpeak, behold it is I.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The true Prophets were no Scepticks; they were as ſure of what they ſaid, that it was the Mind of God, as Miniſters are now, when they preach the Goſpel. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1, 2.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, thoſe by whom <hi>Satan</hi> ſpake, either knew that they were acted by the Devil, as the Witch at <hi>Endor;</hi> Or elſe were deluded by him to think it was God; or elſe knew not, but were uncertain in themſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They had alſo ſome of thoſe ordinary Rules of Tryal that we have now. As for inſtance. If God confute them by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.21, 22,— or if it correſpond with the event; yet if it be contrary to the Fundamentals of Religion. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. Or if they be wicked men on the one ſide, and the Prophets of the Lord on the other— This gave ſome glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Light to <hi>Jehoſaphat.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.7. They were Baalites, pretenders indeed to <hi>Jehovah;</hi> but ſuperſtitious wretches; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not acquieſce in what they had ſaid.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to that, the Text is plain enough: That inſtead of all thoſe divers manners uſed by God of old, he hath now ſubſtituted inſtead thereof this one and only way of revealing himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> in and by his Son.</p>
               <p>And his Son ſpeaks by his Word and Ordinances; as alſo by the Works of his Providence, in all which his Spirit breaths: Therefore there we are to meet with God, and to hear his Voice, and there only to expect it.</p>

               <p n="2">2. They are only to be regarded in the way of a Providence, not in the way of an Ordinance, and to be tryed and judged by the Matter of them, as agreeing or diſagreeing with the Scripture. As if a man in a Dream have ſome Duty, ſome Scripture-truth brought to him, he is to obſerve and accept the Providence of God in it: Or if he find a ſtrong impulſe or motion of the Spirit in his Heart, whereby ſome Truth or Duty is ſtrongly impreſs'd and ſet upon his Heart; Let him examine it by the Scripture, and if the Scripture ſay, it is a Duty, he is to look at that internal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and impreſſion, as a motion of the Spirit of God, elſe not.</p>

               <p>And it is an Inquiry both uſeful and profitable, and alſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightful to an inquiſitive Mind; to view the ſeveral ſtates of Religion, and of the Church of God in the ſeveral ages of the World.</p>

                  <item>2. Under the Law.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Theſe were the two great pieces of it, and the Scripture takes notice of them both.</p>
               <p>Of that Diſpenſation that was before the Law, <hi>from Adam to Moſes;</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Death reigned from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Moſes.</p>
               <p>Of the Diſpenſation under the Law, our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.13. <hi>For all the Prophets and the Law propheſied until</hi> John: again <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.16. <hi>the Law and the Prophets were until</hi> John.</p>
               <p>The difference between theſe two lay chiefly in this; that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the former Diſpenſation, the ordinary way of preſerving the

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Adams</hi> Diſpenſation, I mean, after the Fall. For it is the gradual breakings forth of Goſpel-light whereof the Text ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>We are to conſider how the Lord then ſpake, and how far he revealed himſelf in that age and ſtate of Mankind. Beſides what was common to all times, <hi>viz.</hi> the Works of God, and the Light implanted in mans heart: there were ſeveral things that were the ſpecial Diſcoveries and Light of that Age, I ſhall inſtance in four particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord, having convinced them of their Sin, gave them that famous Promiſe, <hi>that the Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpents Head,</hi> Gen. 3.15.</p>
               <p>This was the firſt Beam of Goſpel-Light that ever brake forth unto loſt and fallen Man: A comprehenſive Promiſe, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the whole Goſpel; as you have formerly heard in many particulars upon that Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p>This great and precious Promiſe they and all the Saints for almoſt four thouſand years did believe and live upon, waiting and longing for the coming of that <hi>bleſſed Seed,</hi> that <hi>victorious Seed,</hi> that <hi>ſhould ſlay the Dragon,</hi> and <hi>deſtroy the Works of the Devil;</hi> as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8.</p>
               <p>It is thought that <hi>Eve</hi> did hope to have ſeen him in her days, and that ſhe her ſelf ſhould have been the immediate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> And thence ſhe called her firſt Son <hi>Cain, Poſſeſſion;</hi> thinking ſhe had now got the Promiſe in poſſeſſion and performance: But afterwards perceiving her miſtake and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96313:19"/>
ſhe called her next Son <hi>Abel, Vanity:</hi> As it is a common error, that we are apt to run into in the exerciſe of Faith upon the Promiſes; we are apt to antedate the time of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, which is from a ſecret mixture and working of unbelief; for <hi>he that believeth ſhall not make haſte,</hi> Iſai. 28.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To this Promiſe the Lord added ſome outward and viſible Signs and Tokens for the further help of Faith. In all times ever ſince God made Man, he hath given him ſome outward and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things, to be Signs and Repreſentations of ſpiritual things, as being ſuitable to the Nature of ſuch a Creature, Man conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both of Soul and Body.</p>
               <p>Even before the Fall there were two Sacramental Trees, the Tree of Life, and the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil: and now under the Goſpel, we have two Sacraments, Baptiſm and the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>So in theſe firſt times after the Fall, they had ſomething of the like nature: The ſignal inſtance hereof is, the Sacrifices, or the ſlaying of clean Beaſts, and offering them, and other things up to God to make atonement. For it is expreſſed that <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> did it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.3, 4. and <hi>Noah</hi> afterwards. Which to have done without Order from God, had been deteſtable and abominable. Therefore there is no doubt, but as they were taught by their Parents; ſo their Parents were inſtructed from the Lord about it.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>Noahs</hi> time, we find there was a diſtinction of Beaſts into clean and unclean, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.2. that is, clean for Sacrifice. For it doth not appear, that any of them were uſed for Food before the Flood.</p>
               <p>What this aimed at, the Scripture is plain, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Without ſhedding of Blood, there is no Remiſſion of Sins:</hi> and Chriſt is ſaid to offer up himſelf a Sacrifice for us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. therefore they did look at Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Before Sin there was no need of any Sacrifice for Expiation of Sin.</p>
               <p>Hence among the Gentiles they had a cuſtom of ſacrificing, from ſome ſlender Fame remaining among them of ſuch an Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for it was no part of the Light of Nature; though they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96313:20"/>
were ignorant of the true God, the true Object to whom to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their Sacrifices: Hither alſo ſome refer that paſſage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.21. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto</hi> Adam <hi>alſo, and to his Wife, did the Lord God make Coats of Skins, and clothed them.</hi> This is thought to have a further My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery included and aimed at in it. For there is a ſpiritual Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often ſpoken of in Scripture.</p>
               <p>As they were under a double Nakedneſs both of Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; their Souls diveſted of Gods Image, and original Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and their Bodies overſpread with Shame: ſo the Lord provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a double Clothing for them: He did not clothe their Bodies, and leave their Souls naked; but he gave them both the upper Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Juſtification, and imputed Righteouſneſs, and the inner Garment of Sanctification and Grace inherent.</p>
               <p>This may be conſidered alſo under another Notion, as one of the Favours of Providence unto thoſe firſt times of fallen Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; that now was the Invention of many uſeful Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Here God himſelf vouchſafes to teach them how <hi>to make Clothes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read alſo in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. of ſundry other Arts and Occupations, as ver. 20. <hi>Jabal was the Father of ſuch as dwell in Tents, and of ſuch as have Cattel.</hi> The meaning of it is well explained in the Margent, the firſt Inventor of Tent making, and of Paſtorage and keeping Cattel. And his Brothers Name was <hi>Jubal: he was the Father of all ſuch as handle the Harp and Organ,</hi> ver. 21. the firſt Inventor of Muſick, I mean Inſtrumental Muſick; For Vocal Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, Nature it ſelf teacheth that. And ver. 22. <hi>The working of Mettals, by</hi> Tubal-Cain, <hi>an Inſtructer of every Artificer in Braſs and Iron:</hi> whence aroſe the Heatheniſh miſtakes and fables of <hi>Vulcan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were great Mercies, and gave ſome further Diſcoveries of God to thoſe who had Eyes and Hearts to ſee him in his Works. For all lawful Arts and Sciences, and all the Rules there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are Beams of Gods Wiſdom, and Gifts, and Operations of his Spirit, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.12. <hi>I Wiſdom dwell with Prudence, and find out Knowledg of witty Inventors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab, Exod.</hi> 31.3. <hi>I have filled him with the Spirit of God in Wiſdom, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and in Knowledg, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96313:20"/>
in all manner of Workmanſhip:</hi> and ver. 6. <hi>I have given with him</hi> Aholiab.</p>
               <p>Thoſe mean Trades and Occupations, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28. are the Gifts of God — The Lord teacheth the Husbandman how to threſh his Corn, and to beat out the Cummin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There was ſomething alſo of Church Diſcipline exerciſed in thoſe firſt Ages of the Church.</p>
               <p>A ſignal Inſtance hereof we have in <hi>Gain, Gen.</hi> 4.12. <hi>A Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and a Vagabond ſhalt thou be in the earth.</hi> God himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth Sentence upon him: ver. 16. he is ſent forth loaden with the Curſe of God from the Fellowſhip of his people.</p>
               <p>This is thought to have been about the hundred and thirtieth year after the Creation of the World. For probably <hi>Eves</hi> next Son, was the next year after <hi>Abels</hi> Death, and then <hi>Adam</hi> was one hundred and thirty years old, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Moreover it is noted, that in <hi>Enos</hi> his time there was a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of things, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.26. <hi>then began men to call upon the Name of the Lord;</hi> which ſeems to be meant of a Segregation of the precious from the vile.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It cannot be meant, that now men began to prophane the Name of the Lord. For the Apoſtacy began before in <hi>Cain,</hi> and his Crew, which was before the Birth of <hi>Enos</hi> one hundred and ſix years.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither can it be meant, that now there was the firſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip of God. For that had been long before by <hi>Abel;</hi> and by <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and others of the Godly in thoſe times.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore it ſeems clearly to be meant of ſome new Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Religion: the wicked party being grown by this time very numerous; the godly, as it ſeemeth, withdrew from them; before, when there was but one <hi>Cain</hi> that had fallen off, Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation might be attained by thruſting him out from among them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But now, ſo great a number, and perhaps the greater part being corrupted, the Godly might not continue and mingle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with them; nor could they caſt them forth. For this, a minor part could not do to the greater part.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:96313:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>5. Therefore they could do no more but withdraw and walk by themſelves; and ſo they came to be called <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> that is, Profeſſors of the true Religion; who were called by this Name; and the other were but <hi>Sons of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all which, it is matter of admiration, that there ſhould be ſo much of oppoſition and averſion in the Minds of ſome, unto all manner of Church-Government and Diſcipline at this day, in this height of Goſpel-Light: the outward Signs and Ceremonies of Religion having been connected with Diſcipline in all Ages, from the firſt Manifeſtation of the Goſpel, even until now.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Lord did in thoſe days inſpire, and raiſe up ſome to be Prophets and Preachers of Righteouſneſs; beſides the Inſtructions of all the godly Parents to the Children.</p>
               <p>There were ſome perſons peculiarly eminent amongſt them: as <hi>Enoch;</hi> he propheſied that there was a day of Judgment com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Jude.</hi> 14. which was partly fulfilled in <hi>Noahs</hi> Flood; but ſhall be more fully and perfectly at the great Day.</p>
               <p>The Name of his Son <hi>Methuſelah</hi> was a Prediction of the Flood. For it ſignifieth <hi>Mortis Gladius,</hi> the Dart of Death; or when he is dead, God will ſend his ſword, his Dart and Arrows of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wrath and Vengeance againſt a wicked World.</p>
               <p>And laſtly <hi>Noah</hi> himſelf a Preacher of Righteouſneſs, he lived amongſt them ſix hundred years before the Flood, and he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and propheſied of the Flood for a hundred and twenty years before it came. Of whom we ſhall ſpeak further by and by.</p>
               <p>Now this firſt Diſpenſation of the Lord unto his Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from firſt to laſt about ſixteen hundred fifty ſix years. For ſo long it was from <hi>Adam</hi> to the Flood: as you will find, if you compute and put together the Lives and Ages of thoſe ten Antediluvian Patriarchs recorded in the fifth Chapter of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there was an Apoſtacy, a falling away from God under this Diſpenſation. It began in <hi>Cain,</hi> and his Unbelief of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. For <hi>by Faith</hi> Abel <hi>offered a more acceptable Sacrifice than he, Heb.</hi> 11.4. therefore the others wanting Faith, made his unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: At laſt he kills his Brother, and being dealt with by God about it, he repented not, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. But in time the Apoſtacy grew
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96313:21"/>
about it, he repented not, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. But in time, the Apoſtacy grew to its height; that <hi>all Fleſh had corrupted his way upon the earth,</hi> Gen. 6.12. and there was a general Atheiſm and Prophaneneſs, <hi>Job.</hi> 22.16, 17.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtacy under this Adamical Diſpenſation of the Goſpel (for I know not what fitter term to expreſs it by) conſiſted chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Senſuality and brutiſh Luſts, they took their ſwinge in their Luſts. This is mentioned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.38. <hi>The Sons of God ſaw the Daughters of Men, and took them Wives</hi> — Hence aroſe all the Heatheniſh Fables of the Adulteries and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of their Gods. For the old Pagan Gods were indeed no other, but thoſe old Gigantine Rebels and Sinners againſt the Lord in the firſt times and ages of the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Violence and Oppreſſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.11. <hi>The Earth alſo was corrupt before God, and the Earth was filled with Violence.</hi> Being men of great Strength, and many of them no doubt Gyants, they did whatſoever they liſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sinful Mixtures and Confuſion between the Church and the World, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. <hi>The Sons of God,</hi> that is, the Profeſſors of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>married with the Daughters of Men,</hi> that is, Profeſſors with ſuch as were prophane. The Sons of God cannot be meant of the Angels, for they were not capable of bodily Luſts, they could not fall in love with Women.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Lord brought in Deſolation, and cut them down with a Flood: as <hi>Job.</hi> 22.16. and ſo put this Adamical Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to an end: but brought in another, and a new Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To <hi>Noah</hi> and his Poſterity. This was the Lords ſecond Diſpenſation to his People. For the Lord would not yet caſt off his Care of wretched Man; but recover him, and ſet him up again once more.</p>
               <p>Now unto all the former Diſcoveries there were ſeveral additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For that great Goſpel-Promiſe, that a Saviour ſhould come, and that <hi>the Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpents Head;</hi> they had that, and did live upon it ſtill; they had alſo Sacrifices,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96313:22"/>
and Cloathing, and Church-Diſcipline; but new Diſcoveries were added: The Lord ſpake ſomething more of his Mind unto them. There were ſome further Beams of Light appearing and ſhining forth upon them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſaved them by Water in the Ark, the Story whereof you have in the 6, 7, and 8. Chap. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> remembred 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. as a Type of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>And (by the way) this could not but be of great uſe to all Poſterity. For though Nature would teach men the uſe of Boats, and leſſer Veſſels, to paſs the leſſer Brooks and Rivers: yet that they had any great Ships before the Flood is not probable: So that here it ſeems was the beginning of the Art of Navigation and Shipping.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He renews his Covenant With them, with <hi>Noah</hi> and all his Seed, even all mankind; and gave them the Rainbow for an outward Sign and Pledge thereof, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.8, 9, 12. to 18.<note place="margin">

                  </note> This is the firſt inſtance where the word <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> is uſed concerning the Tranſactions between God and Men. The Rainbow was the Sign thereof, (the horns downwards, and the back upwards to Heaven, intimating that the Lord will not ſhoot out of his Bow the Arrow of another Deluge) which, whether it were there before, and now only made a Sign of the Covenant, or that now it had its firſt Exiſtence is diſputable. But it is probable enough, that it might be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new: yea, though we ſuppoſe the Rainbow to ariſe from natural cauſes. For a years Deluge could not but cauſe a great alteration in all the Elements, and in the Clouds, and in the Air, whereby there might new <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> new appearances in the Heavens, which never were before.</p>
               <p>Moreover it might be produced by a new creating Power of Providence; beyond the force of any natural cauſes, and alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for a Sign of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>It could not have afforded any great aſſurance to them, if they had only the ſeeing and beholding of it, (which was all that was to be done in this Sacrament,) to ſee nothing but what they had ſeen before; could yield but ſmall comfort and aſſurance to that new World.</p>

               <p n="3">3. He inlargeth their proviſion of Food to eat, by giving them a Commiſſion to eat the Fleſh of the Brute creatures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.3. At firſt there is no mention of any other proviſion, but the Fruits of the Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.29. But there was need of ſome further ſupply; becauſe it is probable, that the Vigor of the Earth, and the Virtue of the Herbs and Plants, and Fruits thereof could not but be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what impaired and decayed by that whole years Winter.</p>
               <p>Therefore, for men upon a Religious account to forbid the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome Meats, as the Papiſts forbid Fleſh in Lent, it is a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Infringement of the Liberty here granted, and given by the Lord unto all the Sons of <hi>Noah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Blood was wholly reſerved and excepted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.4. <hi>But Fleſh with the Life thereof, which is the Blood thereof, ſhall ye not eat.</hi> This ſeems to be done partly upon a moral, and partly upon a ſpiritual and Ceremonial account.</p>
               <p>Moral, for mans Health, and to prevent that Ferity and Savage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which Mankind is ſo apt to degenerate into: as in ſome bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations, they would drink the living Blood out of the Horſe they rode upon, opening a Vein with an Inſtrument when they were thirſty. This is barbarous and ſavage, and this Prohibition here given excludes and forbids ſuch a Practice; which thoſe Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of wickedneſs before the Flood, it is not improbable, but that to other barbarous and raging ſins, they might add the eating of living Creatures alive; therefore the Lord doth ſo directly and expreſly interdict and forbid it.</p>
               <p>And it is the Judgment of ſome very learned men, that the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96313:23"/>
eating of Blood cold, and dreſt as other Meat, was not at all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. For the Prohibition lies not directly againſt Blood, but againſt the eating of living Fleſh, Fleſh animated with the living Blood: For the Blood is the Seat and Chariot of the Life and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits.</p>
               <p>Some think it was done upon a Ceremonial account. The Blood was reſerved as a ſacred thing unto the Lord, till ſuch time as that precious Blood was ſhed, which hath put an end to all Types and Shadows. This is expreſſed <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.11. <hi>I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it to you upon the Altar, to make an atonement for your Souls: For it is the Blood that maketh an atonement for the Soul:</hi> as the former moral Reaſon is expreſſed, <hi>v.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>It is true, the Ceremonial Law came by <hi>Moſes;</hi> but the meaning is, not that there were no parts at all of it before his time; for there were Sacrifices from the Fall of Man: But the meaning is, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did incorporate and ſum them all up together, with many divine enlargements and additions, into that great body of Ceremonial Laws by him eſtabliſhed and ſetled in that Church and People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Therefore there might be a Ceremonial Prohibition of Blood even from <hi>Noahs</hi> time.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Lord now gave unto Mankind that great Ordinance of Magiſtracy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Whoſo ſheddeth Mans Blood, by Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed.</hi> Of which Divines ſay truly, that it is <hi>Remedium corruptae Naturae.</hi> But yet corrupt Nature, ſo far as appears out of the ſacred Hiſtory, never had the Uſe and Benefit of it till now: but rather on the contrary, the Lord ſecures <hi>Cain,</hi> as it were, by ſpecial Diſpenſation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.15. The Government of the World before ſeems to have been only domeſtical and paternal, which might eaſily be; Parents then living ſo long as to ſee whole Towns and Cities of their own Children and Poſterity: But this pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal way of Government was ſo mild, that it was not effectual and ſufficient to reſtrain Vice and Wickedneſs; but it grew to ſuch Gigantick ſtrength and height, that there was a neceſſity to cut them down with a Flood.</p>
               <p>But therefore now to prevent the like Degeneracy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, the Lord puts a ſtronger Bridle of Reſtraint upon the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96313:23"/>
outragious Wickedneſs and Corruption of mans Nature, namely this of Magiſtracy or Civil Government, whereby ſome are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Power of the Sword, to take away the Lives of others in groſſer caſes, eſpecially that of Murther.</p>
               <p n="6">6. God divided the World amongſt them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of three parts then known, though not by theſe names, to wit, <hi>Aſia, Africk,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> whereof <hi>Sems</hi> Poſterity dwelt chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Aſia, Chams</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> and to <hi>Japhets</hi> Poſterity <hi>Europe</hi> fell, known in Scripture by this name, <hi>The Iſles of the Gentiles,</hi> Gen. 10.5. of whoſe Poſterity we our ſelves are.</p>
               <p>And now one would think Mankind was happy, when God thus ſets them up again, begins with them upon a new ſcore as it were.</p>
               <p>But there were three or four things eſpecially that did ruine all, and brought this Diſpenſation to an end.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Apoſtacy of <hi>Cham</hi> and his Poſterity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.22. an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural ſin, to deſpiſe and diſhonour his Parents,<note place="margin">Calvin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let in Cor.</note> and himſelf not a Child when he did this, but above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old, ver. 25. the Curſe is thundred forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Canaan:</hi> ſo the Puniſhment anſwers the Sin. <hi>Cham</hi> is an ungratious Son to his Father, therefore he hath a curſed Son.</p>
               <p>And perhaps <hi>Canaan</hi> might be preſent and Partner in his Fathers Sin; or the moſt delightful of his Children, being the youngeſt; and ſo the Curſing him would be moſt likely to pierce and grieve his Fathers hard Heart: and it may be ſo expreſs'd for the greater comfort of the Iſraelites, that the Nation they were to expel, were a Generation of the Curſe of God: But certain it is, that <hi>Cham</hi> himſelf was intended, and curſed in that Curſe. This fell out about forty years (as ſome reckon) after the Flood.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That impious attempt of building the Tower of <hi>Babel, Gen.</hi> 11.4. whether to ſecure themſelves from another Deluge, through their unbelief and diſtruſt of Gods Promiſe; or thinking to climb into Heaven, a mad Project, but Sinners act ſometimes at a ſtrange rate of Madneſs, not knowing what they do; or that they were moved and acted by Pride and Vain glory, to get them a Name: This the Text expreſſeth, being probably
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96313:24"/>
the end moſt generally aimed at by them; though it is like they had various motives and inducements, and thoſe very fooliſh and wicked.</p>
               <p>This Defection was from that of <hi>Chams,</hi> about ſixty two years, as ſome compute.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There was a ruining Judgment came upon them for this ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> the Confuſion and Diviſion of Tongues; a juſt and ſevere puniſhment (the <hi>Hebrew</hi> being retained among the godly Seed of <hi>Heber:</hi> which was ſo denominated from him, becauſe his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were the chief Preſervers of it) which was a puniſhment that did increaſe the Apoſtacy. For it made the Communication and Propagation of the Light and Knowledg of God amongſt them more difficult.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That provoking ſin of Idolatry, I mean that groſſer ſort of it, worſhipping the Creatures and Images. That the riſe of this Abomination was in this Period, may appear thus.</p>
               <p>If it had been before the Flood, doubtleſs the Lord would have mentioned it amongſt the Cauſes of that Deſtruction: he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons other leſſer ſins, but not this:</p>
               <p>Moreover it was amongſt <hi>Abrahams</hi> Anceſtors when they dwelt beyond the River <hi>Euphrates, Joſh.</hi> 24.2. The place where this Deluſion firſt aroſe, ſeems to be <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is called <hi>the Mother of Fornications,</hi> which is meant of Idolatry, and Spiritual Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as well as bodily, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.5.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Chaldea the Land of graven Images,</hi> Jer. 50.38. therefore it is likely, the firſt riſe of this ſin was at <hi>Babel,</hi> not long after the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Tower of <hi>Babel;</hi> it being an uſual ſtratagem of <hi>Satan,</hi> when his Kingdom hath received ſome deadly ſtroke in one form, to find out ſome new Appearance, ſome new Device to appear in, to recover his Loſſes, and to ſeduce corrupted man again, as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 12. <hi>when the Dragon was caſt down,</hi> when Paganiſh Idolatry was deſtroyed, then he raiſeth up Popiſh Idolatry, cap. 13. Beaſt-worſhip inſtead of Dragon-worſhip.</p>
               <p>So here Atheiſtical Prophaneneſs being teſtified againſt by God from Heaven by the Flood, and then again by confounding the Builders of <hi>Babel; Satan</hi> betakes himſelf to this ſtratagem; that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96313:24"/>
if there muſt be ſome Religion, and ſome Worſhip amongſt men; he would deceive them with a falſe Object, and ſo ſeduce them from the Knowledg and Worſhip of the only true and living God, by preſenting a multitude of falſe Gods.</p>
               <p>But thus this ſecond Diſpenſation was corrupted and loſt: whereupon the Lord ſets his Church and true Religion, as it were, upon a new bottom in <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed.</p>
               <p>This ſecond Diſpenſation under <hi>Noah</hi> continued about four hundred twenty ſeven years, as you will find it, if you compare the Lives of the Patriarchs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>But you muſt remember in the computing of it, that <hi>Terah</hi> was a hundred and thirty years old at <hi>Abrahams</hi> Birth, as appears out of cap. 11.32. compared with cap. 12.4. For <hi>Abraham</hi> was but ſeventy five when his Father <hi>Terah</hi> died, being two hundred and five. Now if ſeventy five be deducted out of two hundred and five, there remains one hundred and thirty. In the reſt of the Computation and Chronology there is no difficulty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And ſo we come to the Lords third Diſpenſation, which was that to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed. Wherein the Lord ſpake forth ſomething more of mind, than ever formerly. There were now brighter Beams of Goſpel-Light ſhining forth upon the Church of God than ever before. I ſhall inſtance but in four particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord calls him forth out of his own Countrey, and from his Fathers Houſe, and ſo plucks him like a Brand out of the Fire, from the midſt of Idols and Idolaters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.31, <hi>from</hi> Ur <hi>of the</hi> Chaldees <hi>to</hi> Haran, and <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. <hi>from</hi> Haran <hi>into</hi> Canaan, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 41.2. <hi>who raiſed up the Righteous man from the Eaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He promiſed him a Seed, a bleſſed Seed; that of him ſhould come that great and bleſſed Seed ſo much expected and longed for by all the Saints ever ſince the firſt Promulgation of the Goſpel to our firſt Parents in Paradiſe: that Seed <hi>in whom both he and all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ. 22.18.</p>
               <p>Till then we do not find any particular and expreſs mention of what Family the Meſſiah ſhould come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:96313:25"/>But now this Promiſe of this Seed is renewed and repeated ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight times over in the Hiſtory of <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Geneſis:</hi> and it is a Promiſe, not only of a numerous Poſterity, and a Church-Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> his Poſterity to be the only Church of God on Earth; but which is more, a Promiſe of that great and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Seed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He promiſed him alſo the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto his Seed after him, when they had ſuffered, and been in an unſetled condition as ſtrangers and pilgrims four hundred and thirty years, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.13. — 18. which was a typical Land, and did relate unto another and a better Countrey beyond that, as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Lord gave him Circumciſion as a Seal of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. <hi>This is my Covenant, which ye ſhall keep between me and you, and thy Seed after thee— Every manchild ſhall be circumciſed.</hi> Rom. 4.11. <hi>He received the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The duration of this Diſpenſation, under which <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the <hi>twelve Patriarchs</hi> and their Poſterity continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and enjoyed God, till the Lord provided further Mercies for them by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> (of which afterwards) I ſay, this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod and State of the Church continued about four hundred and thirty years, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.13—</p>
               <p>We have now gone through the three firſt pieces, the three firſt ſteps and degrees of the Lords gradual Patefactions and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of his Mind before the giving of the Law.</p>
               <p>Thoſe other pieces of Diſcovery under the Law, we ſall ſpeak to (the Lord aſſiſting) afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mean while let us reflect a little upon this that hath been ſaid, in order to ſome practical Improvement of it, in ſome practical Inferences and Inſtructions from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. See the Infant ſtate of the Church and true Religion, how low and weak the firſt beginnings of it were. Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it to <hi>a Grain of Muſtard Seed</hi> Matth. 13.31, 32. in the firſt beginnings under the New Teſtament: It is true alſo of the old times.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:96313:25"/>
                  <hi>Inſtruct.</hi> 2. We may here ſee how prone Mankind is to dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, and fall from God: God no ſooner ſets them up again, but they fall again.</p>
               <p>The Church of God had ſtood but a matter of a hundred and thirty years in <hi>Adams</hi> Family, which included all Mankind; when <hi>Cain</hi> falls into open Murther.</p>
               <p>Well, he is turned out, and a matter of a hundred years after things are ſo corrupted, that <hi>Seth</hi> calls his Son <hi>Enos,</hi> miſerable man.</p>
               <p>Well, about three hundred years after, (as ſome conjecture, for the particular time is not ſet down in the ſacred Hiſtory, but it may be ſuppoſd to be thereabouts from <hi>Cains</hi> Defection and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,) there is a new Reformation in the time of <hi>Enoſh.</hi> How long this reformed ſtate continued is not certain; but ſure it is, that when the World was but ſixteen hundred fifty ſix years old, there was ſuch a general and univerſal Corruption of things, that the Lord thought it neceſſary to cut them down with a Flood: That (as ſome have expreſſed it) all mankind is ſick of the Falling-ſickneſs: Or, as the Lord himſelf complains, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.7. <hi>My Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are bent to backſliding from me: though they called them to the moſt High; yet none at all would exalt him:</hi> though the Prophets called them to repent and turn to the Lord; yet there was none found that would exalt and ſet up God in his heart and life. There is a backſliding bent upon the Heart, like the Byaſs upon the Bowl, that turns it aſide, a departing diſpoſition of ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Behold and ſee the free Grace of God in ſo many recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſpenſations, and renewed Diſcoveries and manifeſtations of himſelf. Oh the Love of God to worthleſs Man! he was loth to give up ſuch a loſt Creature. This is that Divine Philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe old things being paſt and vaniſhed away, do not ſit down with attainments of ſuch low Diſpenſations, but labour for ſuch degrees of Light and Grace, and Communion with God, as becometh Saints under the New Teſtament Adminiſtrations.</p>
               <p>Beloved, the Diſpenſation of the Age wherein we live is high and glorious: But it may be thy particular Diſpenſation is low, thy
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96313:26"/>
own perſonal attainments come very ſhort: Thou art but like a Believer that lived under <hi>Adams,</hi> under <hi>Noahs,</hi> under <hi>Abrahams,</hi> Diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>Signs of a Chriſtian under a low Diſpenſation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When there is an inordinate affecting, and a luſting after out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and viſible, and extraordinary Appearances and Operations, ſuch as they were Wont to have in thoſe childiſh times: Such may be Chriſtians, and may have the root of the matter in them; but they are Chriſtians of the loweſt form. There is a luſting in our hearts, by nature, after ſuch things, after extraordinary Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which God is wont to croſs, as he did in <hi>Naaman,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.11. ſo when Chriſtians linger much after, and lay much weight upon Dreams, and Viſions, and extraordinary Raptures, and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhments of Spirit: or it may be look'd after Miracles, if they hear of any vain pretender thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I had rather have a little ſolid Comfort in that good old plain Scripture way of Faith and Repentance, and labouring with my own Heart to apply the Promiſes; and I value this more, than if an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſhould appear to me out of Heaven, to tell me, that I am a Child of God: For if an Angel ſhould appear to me with ſuch a Meſſage, I profeſs, I ſhould not know whether to believe him or not; but I am ſure, that if I walk cloſe with God, if I exerciſe my ſelf unto Godlineſs, and unto Communion with him in Faith and Prayer, and in ſeeking of him, and humbling my ſelf before him daily; I am ſure, that in this way I cannot miſcarry; if the Goſpel be true, I am ſafe, the Lord keeping me in that way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would not adviſe Believers utterly to reject all Evidences and Comforts, where there is poſſibly ſomething of Enthuſiaſm inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt, if there be a ſuitableneſs to their condition in the Promiſes brought to hand in ſuch a way; and if there be a ſpiritual Savour in the Heart, and a reliſh of the Goſpel, and the Promiſes and Bleſſings of it.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, receive them which way ſoever they be brought to hand, though it be by a Dream.</p>
               <p>But I would exhort you not to reſt in ſuch a way; but labour for an higher and more ſolid and ſpiritual way of Comfort, and Communion with God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:96313:26"/>2. Art thou acted by a ſpirit of Light and Love, or Darkneſs and fear? haſt thou a dark or clear Light?</p>
               <p>It may be thy Candle gives but a dim Light, and ſmokes in the ſocket, as if it were going out: Thou art dark, as to the Light and Work of this age. This is a ſign thou art but low in thy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments. Art thou acted by Fear or Love? If by Fear only, this is low and legal: if by love alſo, this is Goſpel-like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Law genders unto Bondage,</hi> Gal. 4.24. <hi>It was delivered</hi> Heb. 12.18. <hi>with darkneſs and tempeſt:</hi> But the ſpirit of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is a ſpirit of Faith and Love, not of Fear and terror.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Where there is an aptneſs to backſlide and fall off from good beginnings, and to fall again after recovering Diſpenſations. This is but a weak and infant ſtate; as little Children when firſt they begin to go, they catch many a fall.</p>

               <p>We have briefly gone through the ſeveral pieces of Diſcovery, the ſeveral Beams of Goſpel-light that ſhone forth before the Law, during that firſt Period from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond grand Period is that under the Law, from <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> This we are now to ſpeak unto: we may call it the <hi>Legal</hi> or the <hi>Moſaical Diſpenſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this ſeaſon there were further, and clearer, and more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful beamings forth of Goſpel-light upon the Church, above what had been before. Now might the Spouſe ſay, <hi>The Voice of my
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96313:27"/>
Beloved, behold he cometh leaping upon the Mountains, skipping upon the Hills,</hi> &amp;c. Cant. 2.8, 9.</p>
               <p>The Worſhip of God, and the true Religion and Church of God was now reduced to a better conſiſtence and ſettlement in the world than ever before.</p>
               <p>There were two things eſpecially which were the peculiar ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of this Diſpenſation under the Law, wherein it did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel the former, which was before the Law.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That now the true Religion was preſerved and propagated by Writing to Poſterity, which had been done before only or chiefly by Oral Tradition; which might indeed be more eaſily done,<note place="margin">Willet in Gen. <hi>9 28</hi>
                  </note> when men lived ſo many hundred years. For ſome have well obſerved, that three Patriarchs, for the ſpace of two thouſand years and more, from the beginning of the World to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> might ſuffice to propagate true Religion. <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> who lived with him two hundred forty two years, <hi>Methuſelah</hi> to <hi>Sem,</hi> who lived almoſt an hundred years after <hi>Sem</hi> was born; and then <hi>Sem</hi> to <hi>Iſaac;</hi> for <hi>Sem</hi> lived five hundred and two years after the Flood, which reached to the fiftieth year of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> And then all the world had but one Language, whereby they could ſpeak and communicate their thoughts to whomſoever they would; yet as to the generality of mankind the knowledg of God was quite loſt and forgotten by ſome, and by others corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Fables and Superſtitions.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Lives of men came now to be much ſhortened: For before the Flood they lived eight or nine hundred years; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Flood but four or five hundred years. About the time of <hi>Peleg,</hi> when the Tower of <hi>Babel</hi> was built, there was a further decurtation of mens Lives unto two hundred years or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. And laſtly, in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, unto threeſcore or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and there it hath ſtood ever ſince.</p>
               <p>Moreover there was a confuſion of Languages, which did much increaſe the Darkneſs, and obſtruct the Communication and Diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Light among them.</p>
               <p>The way of Oral Tradition is a very inſufficient way, and found by experience ſo to be, as upon other accounts, ſo upon theſe occurring at this time.</p>
               <list>

               </list>
               <p>Upon all which Occurrences the Lord thought it fit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt his Truth no longer with the frail and careleſs Memories of men; but to leave it upon Record in Writing, a much ſafer and ſurer way for the Preſervation and the Propagation of it.</p>
               <p>There is a threefold advantage of this way.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is an help to the weakneſs of Memory: For if a thing be written, there it is, and a man may recall it by reading, when he doth not well remember it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the further Propagation and Diffuſion of the Light: for there may be opportunity of writing to perſons abſent, and and in after times, who may read, when they have not opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of hearing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To prevent Corruption: In the way of Oral Tradition ſome may ſay one thing and ſome another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond preheminence and advantage of this Diſpenſation above the former, was this, that now the Goſpel, and the true Religion and Worſhip of God was ſettled in a whole Nation and People by divine Promiſe and Inſtitution: whereas before it ſeems to have been only in Families and Congregations, formed chiefly according to the Light of Nature, wherein the Ordinances of Worſhip were celebrated by the Fathers and Heads of Families; but now a whole Nation are made the <hi>Teſtes &amp; Cuſtodes</hi> of it, the Witneſſes and the Keepers of it, as a <hi>Depoſitum</hi> committed to their truſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2.</p>
               <p>As to the Occaſions of introducing this new Diſpenſation, they were partly the defections under the former; but chiefly the Lords own Love and Goodneſs. For he had engaged himſelf by his Promiſe, and by his Oath, wherein he had pawned his Truth and Faithfulneſs to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> that he would do great things for their Poſterity. Therefore he is ſaid <hi>to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that Promiſe in the things he did for</hi> Iſrael. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.8, 9, 10. he ſhews that <hi>God remembred his Covenant with</hi> Abraham, Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob. Then followeth a large Rehearſal of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96313:28"/>
towards <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And then he concludes again ver. 42, 43. <hi>For he remembred his holy Promiſe, and</hi> Abraham <hi>his Servant: and he brought forth his People with joy, and his Choſen with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there was need of ſome recovering Diſpenſation, becauſe of thoſe defections that had been from under the Grace and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you look back a little unto <hi>Abrahams</hi> Diſpenſation, you will find, that ſome of his Seed fell off, <hi>viz. Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> when they were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too much of their manners. It is thought their Calf in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.<note place="margin">Geneva Note on Exod. <hi>32.4.</hi>
                  </note> was made in imitation of the Egyptian Idol <hi>Apis,</hi> which was an Ox: <hi>They ſmelled of the Leaven of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, <hi>where they ſaw Calves, Oxen and Serpents wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.</hi> See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.8. <hi>Neither left ſhe her Whoredoms brought from</hi> Egypt: And what is meant by this, is more clearly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly held forth <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.8. <hi>neither did they forſake the Idols of</hi> Egypt: Joſh. 24.14. <hi>put away the Gods, which your Fathers ſerved on the other ſide of the Flood, and in</hi> Egypt.</p>
               <p>Hereupon it was time for God to work, that he might not loſe his People, and to put things into ſome better way: And ſo he brought in another great Diſpenſation, <hi>viz.</hi> that which was under the Law.</p>
               <p>And as we ſubdivided the former Diſpenſation before the Law into three leſſer pieces and parcels, namely, <hi>Adams, Noahs</hi> and <hi>Abrahams</hi> Diſpenſation: ſo we muſt ſubdivide this alſo into ſome leſſer pieces.</p>
               <p>This whole Diſpenſation under the Law may be ſubdivided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to four particulars, under each of which there were remarkable Changes made by God in the ſtate of Religion, and of his Church and People.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Diſpenſation of the Tabernacle and the Judges.</item>
                  <item>2. The Diſpenſation of the Temple and the Kingdom.</item>
                  <item>3. That ſad Diſpenſation of Captivity in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. The Diſpenſation of the ſecond Temple after their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:96313:28"/>The firſt theſe was from <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Temple.</p>
               <p>The ſecond from the Temple to the Captivity in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third from the Captivity to the Return.</p>
               <p>The fourth from the Return to the Meſſiah.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt part of the Lords Diſpenſation to his people under the Law, was from <hi>Moſes</hi> to the building of the Temple, moſt of which time they were under the Government of Judges.</p>
               <p>What the Lord did for them, and how, and what he ſpake; what further Diſcoveries of himſelf he gave them during this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, you may ſee in theſe five particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord, in remembrance of his ancient Promiſe, delivered them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with a high Hand, and with an outſtretched Arm, with great Signs and Wonders, and Plagues upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all his Hoſt, and all his Land, dividing the Sea before them: the Hiſtory of all which is recorded in the Book of <hi>Exodus,</hi> in the firſt fifteen Chapters of that Book, and ſo often celebrated with triumphing Praiſes in the Pſalms and Prophets; who often ſpeak of all his Wonders in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which it is thought were within two months before their departure: and of his dividing the Sea of <hi>Edom,</hi> that his redeemed might paſs through upon dry ground: All which was a Type of Spiritual Redemption al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and therefore it was a Diſpenſation of much Myſtery and Glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He gave them his Law by Word of Mouth from Heaven, and in Writing in the Tables of Stone, and in the five Books of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Both the Moral, Judicial and Ceremonial Law.</p>
               <p>The Moral Law. The Lord came down upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in much Majeſty and Terror, with an Hoſt of Angels; and thundred forth with an audible voice from Heaven thoſe <hi>Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Exod. 19.9. <hi>that the people might hear:</hi> and cap. 20.22. <hi>he talked with you from Heaven: and he wrote them in two Tables of Stone, and in the five Books of</hi> Moſes.</p>
               <p>The Ceremonial and Judicial Laws were delivered in this laſt way, <hi>viz.</hi> by Writing, being left upon Record in the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is celebrated as a choice Mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.7. <hi>He made
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96313:29"/>
known his ways unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>his Acts unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael: yea as a peculiar and diſtinguiſhing Mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.2 laſt v. <hi>He ſheweth his Word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>his Statutes and Judgments unto</hi> Iſrael, <hi>he hath not dealt ſo with any Nation</hi>—</p>
               <p>And now ſeems to have been the firſt Invention of the Art of Writing. The firſt mention we find of it, is in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time. In <hi>Jacobs</hi> time it may ſeem they had no knowledg of it; becauſe in the Covenant between him and <hi>Laban,</hi> inſtead of any Articles in Writing between them, or ſigning or ſealing of it, they only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect an heap of Stones, as Monuments of Remembrance of it. <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.45. <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Invention is ſo admirable, that it ſeems to tranſcend all humane Wit and Induſtry. The reducing of all audible and articulate Sounds unto viſible Marks; and that in ſo familiar and ſhort a way, by twenty or thirty Letters, without any further load to the Memory; that we may well aſcribe it unto God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as the bleſſed Author and Inventor of it; to help his poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to, and in the knowledg of himſelf: according to that in <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.12. <hi>I Wiſdom dwell with Prudence, and find out knowledg of witty Inventions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord accepted the whole Nation to be his own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people, erecting a glorious Frame and Fabrick of Church and Common-wealth amongſt them; wherein the Lord himſelf was King, and did immediately preſide; and therefore it hath been fitly called a Theocracy: ſo <hi>Gideon Judg.</hi> 8.23. <hi>The Lord ſhall rule over you:</hi> Iſai. 51.16. <hi>that I may plant the Heavens, and lay the foundations of the Earth, and ſay unto</hi> Zion, <hi>thou art my People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. He gave them glorious and viſible ſymbols and tokens of his Preſence amongſt them, <hi>walking before them in a Pillar of Cloud and Fire,</hi> Exod. 13.21, 22. which Pillar reſted upon the Tabernacle, after that the Tabernacle was built, <hi>Exod. ult. ult.</hi> which alſo was a ſymbol of his Preſence with them: and ſo was the Ark, and the Manna from Heaven, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.14, 15. with the Rock that followed them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Lord himſelf conducted and led them through the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts of <hi>Arabia</hi> by the Hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and into the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96313:29"/>
by the Hand of <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> drying up <hi>Jordan</hi> for them, ſubduing the Inhabitants before them, raiſing up Judges and Rulers for them; and finally training them up by many inſtructing Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences to fit them for the further Mercies he had yet in ſtore for them.</p>
               <p>One would think all things were now well ſetled; but there were two or three things, partly defects in this Diſpenſation it ſelf, and partly ſome provoking evils on their part under it; by reaſon whereof the Lord brought in a further and an higher Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on afterwards.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There had been ſtrange Rebellions and Provocations in the Wilderneſs, which have had an influence into all the ſorrows and troubles that have befallen them ever ſince.</p>
               <p>Murmuring againſt God.</p>
               <p>Mutining againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> which the Lord took very hainouſly; and therefore deſtroyed <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> by miracle. For to diſobey the juſt Commands of a lawful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, is to rebel againſt God himſelf.</p>
               <p>And above all Idolatry, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.34, 35 <hi>In the day when I viſit, I will viſit their Sin upon them, and the Lord plagued the people, becauſe they made the Calf which</hi> Aaron <hi>made.</hi> From whence the Jews have a proverb, that in every affliction in every calamity that comes upon them, there be ſome grains of the Molten Calf in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There were frequent Degeneracies and Oppreſſions under the Judges.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Tabernacle was unfixed.</p>
               <p>Upon all which accounts the Lord had not yet ſatisfied himſelf, in the expreſſions of his own Love towards them; but his Heart was full, and he was reſolved to do yet more for them, and ſo to try them to the utmoſt. Therefore he was pleaſed to put a period unto this Diſpenſation, which began about the year of the World two thouſand five hundred and thirteen, and laſted about four hundred eighty ſeven or eighty eight years. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lords ſecond Diſpenſation under the Law was from the Temple to the Captivity in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Period the Glory of the Legal Diſpenſation roſe up to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96313:30"/>
the greateſt height and ſplendor; and that chiefly in two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, the Glory of the Kingdom and Temple.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Kingdom was ſetled in the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> as the Type and Progenitor of the Meſſiah.</p>
               <p>And in his days and <hi>Solomons</hi> it extended to the utmoſt bounds, that God had ſpoken of to <hi>Abraham:</hi> though afterwards for their own ſins they were cut ſhort; the neighbour Nations ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the yoke, and the Kingdom it ſelf divided into two parts; two Tribes only left to <hi>Solomons</hi> Poſterity.</p>
               <p>The Lord had promiſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>his Seed ſhould poſſeſs all the Land to the River</hi> Euphrates, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.18.</p>
               <p>And it was performed in <hi>Davids</hi> time, and in <hi>Solomons,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.21, 24. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.26.</p>
               <p>And this Kingdom was a Type of the Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other piece of their Glory was the Temple. Before God had dwelt in Tents; but now he had an Houſe built unto his Name. The Lord turned his flitting Tabernacle into a fixed Temple; for which <hi>David</hi> made plentiful Preparation; <hi>Solomon</hi> did erect and ſet it up. He did it in ſeven or eight years time, or more preciſely ſeven years and an half: for he began it in the ſecond month, and finiſhed it in the eighth, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6.1, and <hi>ult.</hi> and he began it in the fourth year of his Reign, and finiſhed it in the eleventh: moreover he began it in the 480th year after the coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and dedicated it ſeven or eight years after, which fell into the year of the World three thouſand, or three thouſand and one, as you will find, if you take the pains to compute and put all the former Periods together.</p>
               <p>And their Kingdom and Temple ſtood in ſome degree of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Glory about four hundred years from the finiſhing and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of it, to the beginning of their Bondage under the Yoke of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now one would think they had been ſetled in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as might have ſtood for ever.</p>
               <p>But the Apoſtacies were very great, which brought this high and proſperous Diſpenſation to an end, to a ſad end. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The peoples hearts being not ſo with God as became a people
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96313:30"/>
crowned with ſuch Glory, God left them and their Princes, the firſt and wiſeſt of them, the very Founders of their Kingdom and Temple, unto very great and enormous tranſgreſſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> committed Adultery and Murther, a very unparallell'd caſe; for which the Lord threatneth, the Sword ſhould never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from his Houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> was left to the toleration of the publick exerciſe of Idolatry, for which God rent away the Ten Tribes from his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity: all which came to paſs, as for other cauſes, ſo for the Sins of the People. As it ſaid in a leſſer tranſgreſſion of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1. <hi>And the Anger of the Lord was kindled againſt</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and he moved</hi> David <hi>againſt them, to ſay, Go number</hi> Iſrael <hi>and</hi> Judah.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ten Tribes under <hi>Jeroboam</hi> forſook the Temple and the Houſe of <hi>David;</hi> which, though as to Gods Providence, it was a righteous Judgment; yet on their part it was a grievous ſin; it was a complicated Sin, many Sins involved in the bowels of it; for it was both Rebellion, and Schiſm, and Hereſie; Rebellion againſt their lawful Prince, Schiſm from the true Church and Worſhip: yea fundamental Hereſie. For as they ſay, <hi>Look to thy Houſe O</hi> David: ſo in rejecting <hi>Davids</hi> Houſe, they reject the Meſſiah, who was to come of him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10.16.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There were continual Backſlidings to Idolatry, even in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> as well as <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yea when they ſaw the Ten Tribes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away before their eyes for this Sin; yet the other would not take warning and reform. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.10, 11 — <hi>Aholah</hi> ſignifies a Tent; this was the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who were a corrupt Church: <hi>Aholibah</hi> ſignifies, my Tent is in her; this was <hi>Judah,</hi> which were the true Church of God; but they declined and departed from God ſo far, that he ſent them away to <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And ſo we come to the third Diſpenſation under the Law, namely, the time of their Captivity and Bondage under the Yoke of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were three Deportations.</p>

               <p>Yet during the time of this Affliction, the Lord did not caſt off his care of them; but gave forth many Evidences of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Love and Faithfulneſs toward them, under this ſad Diſpenſation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that he did preſerve them from utter Deſtruction; yet not leave them altogether unpuniſhed, not make a full end of them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.10, 11.</p>
               <p>He reſtrained the Enemy from wholly rooting out the Nation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.46— gave them Favour in the ſight of them that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them captive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that he did convince them, and left an everlaſting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction in the Heart of that people againſt the groſſer ſort of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: ſuch an indelible Conviction as hath never been blotted out to this day.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch, that their great ſtumbling Block at this day againſt the Chriſtian Religion is, the Idolatry of the Popiſh Chriſtians: For the poor blind Jews conſider the Chriſtian Religion no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but as corrupted with thoſe Antichriſtian Abominations and Idolatries: and therefore their Converſion and Return is not to be expected till Antichriſt, that great ſtumbling Block, be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the way.</p>
               <p>Yea, 3. The Lord gave them further and glorious Diſcoveries, by raiſing up excellent Prophets to them: as <hi>Ezekiel, Daniel, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi> ſome part of his Propheſies were after the beginning of their Captivity and Bondage to the <hi>Babylonians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſad afflictive Diſpenſation continued about ſeventy years, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth and laſt of all the Old Teſtament Diſpenſations is that of the ſecond Temple, from the time of their Return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> till the Meſſiahs coming. And herein there are theſe remarkable paſſages.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord breaks the Yoke of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that his people might be delivered by the Hand of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> propheſied of by name ſome hundred years before his Birth, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.28.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:96313:31"/>And as they were carried away at ſeveral times: ſo they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned alſo at ſeveral times, and by degrees.</p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>Zerubbabel, Ezra</hi> 1. and a great company with him: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Ezra, Ezr.</hi> 7.1. <hi>after theſe things</hi>—</p>
               <p>Laſtly <hi>Nehemiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They built the Temple and the City of God again, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 3. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1, and 2.</p>
               <p>They met with many Difficulties and Obſtructions in the Work; but yet at laſt it was done; both begun and finiſhed by <hi>Zerubbabel, Zach.</hi> 4. in forty ſix years, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven weeks, that is, forty nine years; <hi>viz.</hi> from the Edict of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> after which, we may well allow one year of preparation for their Journy, another year for their Journy, and a third year for prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Materials for the Temple, wherein <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpent ſo many years: And if we deduct three out of forty nine, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will be but forty ſix; as <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20. It wanted ſomewhat of its former Glory as to the Structure thereof, the old men wept to ſee how much <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> Temple fell ſhort of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, in <hi>Ezr.</hi> 3.12.</p>
               <p>As to the Utenſils belonging to it; the Ark was wanting, with the things contained in it, the two Tables of Stone, the Rod of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Pot of Manna: alſo the extraordinary and miraculous tokens of Gods Preſence, as Fire from Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lord would have them now to be more ſpiritual, to ſee his Preſence by Faith, when they could not ſee it with their eyes.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Haggai</hi> ſaith, it had a greater Glory, that is, in regard of the Meſſiahs bodily preſence in it, which <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple never had.</p>

               <p n="4">4. The Lord guides them to the reforming of ſundry Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which had crept in amongſt them, and raiſeth them up to an higher pitch of Reformation than ever. Groſs Idolatry, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook that for ever; of which we ſpake before. The Preaching of the Word was reſtored and renewed among them, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.1-8.

               <p>And the Hiſtories of the Church in thoſe times report alſo how there was great care to get true and perfect Copies of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and to review the Copies they had.</p>
               <p>And hither (as I ſuppoſe) belongs that famous work of the Punctation of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Conſonants.</p>
               <p>Much Diſpute there is among learned men about it. That it is of a Divine Original and Authority is unqueſtionable, if we do but grant the Divine Authority of the Scripture. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Senſe will be <hi>vagus &amp; incertus,</hi> wandring and uncertain.</p>
               <p>Some think, it was as ancient as the firſt Invention of Letters, which is referred to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if we ſuppoſe that Writing (as all other uſeful Arts are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) was brought to perfection by degrees; and that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants might ſuffice while it was a Mother tongue of ſo great a People, and they in ſuch a flouriſhing condition, not oppreſſed nor mingled with other People and Languages; yet poſſibly the Points might be added afterwards. For when they fell under the Yoke of ſtrangers, this help became neceſſary to be added: The Lord therefore did by <hi>Ezra</hi> and others, who were divinely inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, now at leaſt add them. For to refer it to an humane O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, is to overthrow the divine Authority of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Yea the Lord raiſeth them to an higher pitch of Reformation than ever. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. They kept the Feaſt of Tabernacles ſo as it had not been kept from the days of <hi>Joſhua.</hi> Doubtleſs <hi>David</hi> and other reforming Kings had kept it; but that part of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, the dwelling in Booths had been, as it may ſeem, omitted and neglected by them; another Corruption was the mixture of the Church with Heathens by ſtrange Marriages, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 9, and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</hi> 10. and the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> thoſe Mongrels, would have intrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but were rejected. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Thus they purged and reformed themſelves from both theſe corrupting mixtures in the matter of the Church.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, the Old Tetament was concluded by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Malachy,</hi> who was the laſt of all the Prophets. The Lord would have no Prophet beyond the firſt times of the ſecond
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96313:32"/>
Temple; nor no Writings of men in the age immediately after the Apoſtles, immediately following the Goſpels Promulgation. That it might manifeſt it ſelf more clearly by its own own Light to be ſupernatural.</p>
               <p>This Period, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the ſecond Temple, continued <hi>four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ninety years,</hi> Dan. 9.24. ſeventy, Prophetical weeks is four hundred and ninety ſolar years.</p>
               <p>Now ſuch a people thus delivered and reſtored; twice delivered out of Bondage, firſt out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and then a ſecond time out of <hi>Babylon:</hi> one would think they would have abiden with the Lord for ever after.</p>
               <p>And one thing they did learn, <hi>viz.</hi> to forſake groſs Idolatry, and this was all.</p>
               <p>But they grew more rigidly formal, and exquiſitely hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical than ever: and Religion ran out into Sects and Parties and Factions amongſt them. There were <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Galilaeans</hi> and <hi>Herodians</hi> amongſt them, Names which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture mentions, and Hiſtories ſpeak of another Sect, called the <hi>Eſſenes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus it was with them when our Lord Jeſus came in the Fleſh: The inward and ſpiritual part of Godlineſs, and the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of that which is truly ſo, was in a very great meaſure loſt amongſt them; being eaten out partly by their Sects and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, partly by their rigid Formality and Hypocriſie: And thence at laſt the Lord ſending his Son their Meſſiah, ſo long promiſed and longed for by them, they reject and crucifie him: So the Lord having, by all theſe various Diſpenſations and turnings of his hand, mended the old Houſe, as it were, ſeven times over; he reſolves now at laſt to pull it down: for all theſe legal Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations were but the mending, as it were, and repairing of the old Houſe: but the Goſpel pulls it quite down, and builds a new one.</p>
               <p>Thus I have led you thorough the <hi>ſeveral times and ſeaſons</hi> wherein the Lord ſpake unto them of old: you have ſeen the gradual progreſs of the Light and Work of God among them, in thoſe ſeven pieces of the Old Teſtament Diſpenſation which have been briefly run thorough.</p>

                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:96313:33"/>That which follows next to be ſpoken to, is the Reaſons of the Point, why the Lord ſpake and revealed his mind in ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ways and manners, and in theſe ſeveral pieces and parcels; neither in one way only, nor at one time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What may be the Reaſons of the Point? The Lord could have ſpoke his whole Mind at once, in one way, and at one time; therefore why did he ſpeak in ſuch divers manners, and in ſo many ſeveral pieces and parcels?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although it is a ſufficient general account, to ſay, that this or that is beſt, becauſe God wills it: For he doth all things well, and his Will is the Rule of Goodneſs; and it is not for us to call him to an account of what he doth: yet we may humbly and modeſtly inquire into the reaſon of things, not to contend him with for doing ſo; for that were Prophaneneſs: but to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſomething of his Wiſdom therein.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons therefore may be referred to two heads.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In regard of our Weakneſs.</item>
                  <item>2. For his own greater Glory.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I ſhall ſpeak briefly unto both theſe, adding but a little unto what others have ſaid upon this Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. In regard of our Weakneſs. The Lord herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends, and accommodates himſelf unto us.</p>
               <p>You may ſee his Condeſcention in four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that we are dull and ſlow of underſtanding to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Truth. Therefore the Lord illuſtrates the ſame things ſeveral ways: like the Light ſhining into the Houſe at ſeveral Windows, that in ſuch a plenty of Light, ſome of all thoſe Beams may ſhine into our Hearts, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.25. we are ſlow of Heart to believe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are but narrow-mouth'd Veſſels, not able to receive much at once. As we are ſlow to receive any thing at all: ſo we are uncapable to receive much at once. Therefore the Lord teacheth us here a little and there a little: a little to <hi>Adam,</hi> a little more to <hi>Noah,</hi> and a little more to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet more fully and copiouſly to <hi>Moſes;</hi> leading them on by degrees, as they were able, that ſo men in ſeveral ages might know what their
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96313:33"/>
Fathers did, and ſomething more. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28.9, 10, 13.<note place="margin">Geneva Note in loc.</note> They muſt have one thing oftentimes told.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By this various and gradual proceeding God did prepare and fit his People, by weaker and lower Diſpenſations, for further and higher Diſpenſations. As a Child by learning his A. B. C. and his Primmer, is fitted to go into an higher, harder Book: ſo the Church of God by thoſe immediate Revelations and Viſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo frequent in thoſe firſt times when they wanted the written Word, was fitted to receive the Scriptures with the more Deſire, and Reverence, and Faith. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.9. <hi>Lo, I come unto thee in a thick Cloud, that the People may hear when I ſpeak with thee, and believe thee for ever.</hi> And they did believe him ever after: ſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.29. <hi>We know that God ſpake unto</hi> Moſes.</p>
               <p>So the Church of God being exerciſed under the Moſaical Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogy ſo long together, they were thereby prepared to welcom the Goſpel more gladly when it came.</p>
               <p>How gloriouſly and joyfully was it entertained when they had waited for it about four thouſand years! with what Triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in God! that now <hi>they ſaw that which Kings and Prophets and righteous men have deſired to ſee, but it had not been granted to them.</hi> ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.23, 24. <hi>That which all the Prophets had ſpoken of ſince the World began.</hi> Luk. 1.70. Act. 3.24. <hi>The Myſtery that had been hid from Ages and Generations.</hi> Col. 1.26.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth Condeſcention of the Lord herein is this. By theſe varieties of Diſpenſation the Lord provides to have his Truth ſet on with all kind of Arguments, yea with Arguments of peculiar concernment and ſuitableneſs to take with us.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Jews. <hi>The Lord made not this Covenant with our Fathers, but with us,</hi> Deut. 5.3. <hi>And Manna which thy Fathers knew not,</hi> Deut. 8, 16.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.34. <hi>A new Commandment give I unto you.</hi> And the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.8. <hi>A new Commandment I write unto you.</hi> It was an old Commandment, but ſet out in a new dreſs, given forth in a new manner. The Lord adorns his Truths with new Ornaments, as it were, that men may be excited to Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Affections ſuitable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:96313:34"/>Hence in every Age there be in one reſpect or other new Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, or new Diſpenſations and Dealings of God with his People.</p>
               <p>Or if men be taken with Antiquity. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.7. <hi>I write no new Commandment; but an old Commandment</hi> for the ſubſtance of things: <hi>The good old way of Faith and Holineſs remains,</hi> which all the Saints of God have gone to Heaven in, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. he ſhews the ſame Race which he ſets before them had been run by all the Saints, from <hi>Abel,</hi> cap. 12.1. <hi>being compaſſed about with ſo great a Cloud of Witneſſes, let us run our race that is ſet before us:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay; I exhort you to nothing but what all thoſe Saints of old have done before you: and yet ver. 40. he profeſſeth God hath better things for them, an higher and better Diſpenſation: and cap. 12.18. <hi>Ye are not come to Mount</hi> Sinai; <hi>but ye are come to Mount</hi> Sion, ver. 22. here he fetches an argument from this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Diſpenſation, and from the preheminence of that which they wore under above former times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. For his own greater Glory. And under this head ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things come in to be conſidered. This various and gradual Diſpenſation tends to his greater Glory divers ways.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That there may be an harmony between this and the other Works of God.</item>
                  <item>2. To ſhew the ineſtimable Worth and Glory of the Myſtery of the Goſpel of his Son.</item>
                  <item>3. To manifeſt the variety of his Wiſdom.</item>
                  <item>4. His abſolute Liberty. And,</item>
                  <item>5. His peculiar Goodneſs.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. That there might be an harmony between this and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Works of God. It is ſo in other works of God, as well as in his ſpeaking and revealing of his Mind. As in the Creation of the World, he could have made it all at once; but he choſe rather to make it in ſix days: and he made various and ſeveral kinds of Creatures. Therefore this variety of Adminiſtration in the Diſcoveries of himſelf and his Goſpel is ſuitable to all the reſt of his Works, wherein he ever delights, with Unity to mix Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with Identity Diverſity, and Diſagreement in ſome reſpects, with Conſent in other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:96313:34"/>So we ſee in the outward Lineaments of mens Faces: ſo in the inward abilities and diſpoſitions of their Minds, both in the common and ſaving, in natural and ſpiritual endowments; what a wonderful Compoſition there is, and how great variety: and ſo indeed in every Creature and Work of God. Though in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>Omnia fiunt ab uno ad unum.</hi> God is the Author and the End of all.</p>
               <p>So in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 5, 6. <hi>there are diverſities of Gifts, differences of Adminiſtrations, diverſities of Operations, but from the ſame Author.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Calv. in loc.</note> 
                  <hi>Symmetria Eccleſiae multiplici ut ita loquar unitate conſtat;</hi> the Symmetry of the Church conſiſts, as I may ſo ſay, in a manifold Unity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To manifeſt the ineſtimable Worth and Glory of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Goſpel of his Son; which appears in this, in that it is attended with ſuch a multitude of means of divers kinds for the Diſpenſation of it.</p>
               <p>That ſo many ordinances, Providences, Perſons and things in ſeveral ages of the World ſhould all be ſubſervient to the Exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of this one Myſtery of Chriſt, and Redemption by him: This ſhews the Glory of it, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To manifeſt the variety of his Wiſdom, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>variegata ſapientia.</hi> It is like a party coloured Garment, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.10.</p>
               <p>As in the works of Creation and Providence: ſo it is in the Diſpenſations of his Grace: the Wiſdom of God cannot be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently manifeſted in any one, or in a few things; or in one manner of working: And therefore it refracts it ſelf into many parcels, and ſcatters its Beams every manner of way: that all put together may argue unto Man the inexhauſtible depth and infinite largeneſs thereof: Hence he hath found out many ways and means to convey the ſame Grace: and every ſeveral manner hath ſome peculiar Beam of Wiſdom and Worth in it.</p>
               <p>This great variety and change of his Diſpenſations was not becauſe in proceſs of time God found out a better way, and ſo relinquiſh'd the old; as in the work of Creation, he did not profit by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though he made Man laſt, the moſt perfect Creature laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:96313:35"/>For the Inequalities and Degrees of things came from the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, as well as the divers kinds of them; and every thing is beſt in its place, and kind, and proportion to the whole, though not ſimply and in it ſelf. It is beſt that in a body there ſhould be a Foot, as well as an Head, though ſimply, and in it ſelf the Head be more excellent. The Wiſdom of God appears not only in the individual natures of things; but in their references and proportions to other things, and to the whole whereof they are parts: ſo it is better, and the Wiſdom of God appears more in that there was both a Legal and a Goſpel Diſpenſation of Chriſt and his Benefits, though the Goſpel Diſpenſation be in it ſelf far the more excellent.</p>
               <p>Therefore this is a third Beam of his Glory that ſhines forth herein, <hi>viz.</hi> his manifold Wiſdom. As there is infinite Wiſdom in every thing God doth: ſo he would have us ſee it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This variety of Diſpenſation manifeſts the Lords abſolute Freedom, and Liberty, and Soveraignty in the uſe of Means and Inſtruments, that he is not tyed to any of them: He can work by little or by great means, by few or many. He can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the ſame Grace to his Church either in a Family-way, or in a Nation, or in all Nations. For the Church of God was firſt a Family, then <hi>in populo Iſraelitico,</hi> and now <hi>in populo Catholico.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He can reveal himſelf either by ordinary or extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; either in a more immediate way, or in a mediate way. He hath not limited himſelf to one way, or time, or manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, leſt we ſhould aſcribe the Glory to the Means, to the Tools, rather than the bleſſed Workman and Author. Therefore he is pleaſed ever and anon to change the Means, to break his Tools, as it were, and throw them away, and make new ones.</p>
               <p>Hence, if men begin to think that a Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> hath any Salvation in it, he will burn it up, and be <hi>worſhipped in ſpirit and truth</hi> in every Cottage; as <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. <hi>pure Incenſe every where, Mal.</hi> 1.11.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth Beam of Divine Glory that ſhines forth in this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Adminiſtration is this, the Glory of peculiar Goodneſs, which the Lord will receive by this means from every Saint

of his, according to his peculiar dealing with him.</p>
               <p>Some will bleſs him for Multitude and Excellency of Means, others will admire his Power and Grace in working by ſmall and weak means: ſome will praiſe him for one kind of Diſpenſation, others for another kind. As for inſtance. A New-Teſtament Saint will praiſe God that he cauſed him to live in the Noon-day, and under the higheſt Meridian of Goſpel-Light; when the Earth was full of the Knowledg of the Lord. Oh, what ſhould I have been, if my lot had fallen under former times of Ignorance and Darkneſs.</p>
               <p>But another in thoſe former darker times, (as for inſtance <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>) he will admire and wonder at Gods Mercy, that when Darkneſs was round about him; yet the Lord opened his eyes, to ſpy the Sun of Righteouſneſs peeping up; and cauſed him then to rejoyce to ſee Chriſts Day: that his Fleece was wet, when the reſt of the Earth was dry; his Heart drawn after God and Chriſt, when the means were ſo ſcant and ſmall.</p>
               <p>One Believer will bleſs God, that the Lord was known to him by his Name <hi>Jehovah:</hi> Another will admire that he did enable him to believe on God Almighty.</p>
               <p>Some will bleſs him, that they have ſeen the Accompliſhment of his Promiſes and Predictions; <hi>and not one thing hath failed of all the Good that God hath ſpoken,</hi> as <hi>Joſh.</hi> 23.14.</p>
               <p>Another under former Diſpenſations will admire that his Heart was wrought to embrace the Promiſes afar off, and that the Lord made Faith to him, to be the ſubſtance of things not ſeen.</p>
               <p>Beloved, the Lord makes his Goodneſs ſpecial and peculiar by variety of Diſpenſations even to Believers living in the ſame age, and in the ſame place: that though in general they be all alike made partakers of the ſame common Salvation; yet ſuch variety there is in the Lords dealings with them, in regard of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; that in one reſpect or other, in regard of one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or other, every one hath experience of peculiar loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſingular ſtrains of Mercy; that he can ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch a pattern of Mercy; I have more to bleſs God for, than any other in all the world beſide.

ages: ſo that look as that variety of Wiſdom in ſo many ſeveral things before noted, did declare the infiniteneſs of Gods Wiſdom: ſo in like manner theſe various kinds and ways of Goodneſs being all laid together, will yield the luſtre of infinite Goodneſs ſo far as finite Creatures can contain or conceive it. I ſay, when all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are computed, and put together in one ſum total (as they ſhall be when that general Aſſembly of all the Saints and Angels ſhall meet together at the great Day, when they ſhall all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Notes as it were.) It will then appear, that there is no chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel wherein Mercy hath not run, no expreſſion of loving Kindneſs that hath been omitted: ſo manifold have his Diſpenſations been, that every Age, and every Perſon ſhall be able to bring in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral and peculiar portions into the common Treaſury of Gods Mercies and Praiſes; and they ſhall all ſay and ſing together that Song of Praiſes in <hi>Pſal</hi> 40.5. <hi>Many, O Lord my God, are thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works, which thou haſt done, and thy Thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and ſpeak of them, they are more than can be numbred.</hi>

               <p>The Anſwer may be gathered from all that hath been ſaid upon this Subject, that it laſted preciſely <hi>four thouſand years.</hi> This will appear, if you compute and put thoſe ſeven Old-Teſtament Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations together, which were formerly ſpoken to.</p>
               <p>The firſt Diſpenſation <hi>from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Noah <hi>was ſixteen hundred fifty ſix years.</hi>

They were the Corruption of Old-Teſtament Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations.

We may learn from hence to ſee the Glory of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, yea the Riches of the Glory of the Myſtery of the Goſpel; in that it was ſo long, and with ſo great variety of Diſpenſation held forth to the Church of God of old.</p>
               <p>Surely it was no ſmall matter which the Lord made uſe of ſuch various Providences and Diſpenſations to reveal: for they did all tend to, and aim at this, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26. <hi>The Myſtery which hath been hid from Ages, and from Generations:</hi> ver. 27. <hi>the Riches of the Glory of this Myſtery.</hi> Therefore learn to prize the Goſpel accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this worth and this value that God hath put upon it.</p>
               <p>To ſlight it, is to ſlight all the Glory and glorious Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God from the beginning of the World to this day.</p>
               <p>For this they did all look at.</p>
               <p>A man acknowledges the Glory of the Myſtery in two things.</p>

               <p>And to do ſo under ſuch a clear Diſpenſation of it, as in New Teſtament times, certainly the deepeſt place in Hell will be their Portion.</p>

               <p>I beſeech you, give unto God the Glory due unto his Name in all his Diſpenſations.</p>
               <p>Praiſe him for his Condeſcention to our Weakneſs.</p>
               <p>Obſerve the Harmony that is among his Works.</p>

               <p>I ſhall content my ſelf with the Apoſtles Definition of it: That <hi>a Type is a Shadow of good things to come.</hi> Hebr. 10.1. <hi>The Law having a Shadow of good things to come.</hi> Col. 2.17. <hi>Which are a Shadow of things to come, but the Body is of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be three things included in this Deſcription.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. There is ſome outward or ſenſible thing that repreſents ſome other higher thing.</item>
                  <item>2. There is the thing repreſented thereby, which is <hi>good things to come,</hi> which we call the <hi>Antitype.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. There is the work of the <hi>Type,</hi> which is to <hi>ſhadow forth</hi> or repreſent theſe <hi>future good things.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. There is in a <hi>Type</hi> ſome outward or ſenſible thing that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents an higher ſpiritual thing, which may be called a Sign or a Reſemblance, a Pattern or Figure, or the like.</p>
               <p>Here is the general Nature of a <hi>Type;</hi> it is <hi>a Shadow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath been the Goodneſs and Wiſdom of God in all times and ages, to teach Mankind heavenly things by earthly, ſpiritual and inviſible things by outward and viſible; as <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is the thing ſhadowed or repreſented by the <hi>Type,</hi> And what is that? <hi>Things to come,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. and <hi>good things to come,</hi> Heb. 10.1. The good things of the Goſpel, Chriſt and his Benefits; <hi>but the Body is of Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17.</p>
               <p>This we call the Correlate, or the <hi>Antitype;</hi> the other is the Shadow, this the Subſtance: the <hi>Type</hi> is the Shell, this the Kernel; the <hi>Type</hi> is the Letter, this the Spirit and Myſtery of the <hi>Type.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This we are ſtill to look at, and to ſearch into in every <hi>Type;</hi> we muſt look beyond the Shadow, to the Subſtance, to the Truth and Myſtery of it: and this is Chriſt and the Goſpel, as future, and hereafter to be exhibited.</p>
               <p>This may be called the <hi>Prototype,</hi> or the Pattern, out of which, and according to which the other is drawn; as Pictures from the Man whoſe Viſage they repreſent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Deſcription holds forth the Work of the <hi>Type,</hi> which is to ſhadow forth the <hi>Antitype.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:96313:38"/>But what is this <hi>ſhadowing?</hi> and how do they ſhadow it?</p>
               <p>It is a metaphorical expreſſion. A Shadow repreſents the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Body, with its actions and motions; though it doth it but obſcurely and darkly.</p>
               <p>So the Types had ſome dark reſemblance of Chriſt and his Benefits, and did ſome way adumbrate and repreſent them, and hold them forth unto his People, to enlighten and inform their Underſtandings, and to ſtrengthen and confirm their Faith in him: The <hi>Types</hi> had this Voice and Language; Such an One ſhall the Meſſiah be, He is thus to act, and thus to ſuffer for you.</p>
               <p>Thus you have the Deſcription of <hi>a Type.</hi> It is a ſhadow of good things to come: or if you would have it more at large, you may take it thus,</p>
               <p>A Type is ſome outward or ſenſible thing ordained of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament, to repreſent and hold forth ſomething of Chriſt in the New.</p>
               <p>It may be otherwiſe worded. But the Deſcription, if it be true, muſt be to this effect; as if we ſay, that a Type is an inſtituted reſemblance of Goſpel-Truths and Myſteries; or that it is a Sign holding forth Chriſt, or ſomething of Chriſt in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>You ſee it comes all to one ſcope; and indeed all the Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions that our Divines have given of it are to this effect, they are all to the ſame ſcope with this of the Apoſtle; <hi>a Shadow of good things to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For Rules for your further underſtanding of them, take theſe four.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 1. That God is the only Author of the Types. They belong to the ſecond Commandment, as matters of Inſtitution. Therefore <hi>Calvin,</hi> excellently and judiciouſly harmoniſing the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> referreth the Ceremonial Laws to the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
               <p>There is ſomething of Chriſt ſtamped and ingraven upon them by Divine Inſtitution: They are not meer natural or arbitrary ſimilitudes; but they were inſtituted and ſet apart by God for that end, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt this ſignifying</hi> — &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:96313:39"/>Hence that Sacramental phraſe and manner of expreſſion, <hi>That Rock was Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. like that in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>The Lamb is the Paſſover.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the Church under the New Teſtament hath not power to make Sacraments to themſelves: ſo they of old could not make <hi>Types — Act.</hi> 7.43. <hi>The Types which you made to worſhip them,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Amos</hi> 5.26. <hi>Images which you made to your ſelves — contra</hi> ver. 44 of <hi>Act.</hi> 7. — <hi>the Tabernacle which</hi> Moſes <hi>made, as he had appointed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it ſeems, by the ſacred Hiſtory, that they had ſomething of the notion of a <hi>Type,</hi> in their heads in that Invention. For they ſay, <hi>Make us Gods that may go before us; and they proclaim an Holy day to</hi> Jehovah; therefore they intended the Calf to be an outward and viſible Sign to them of his Preſence.</p>
               <p>Here ariſeth a Queſtion. How may we know when a thing is a <hi>Type,</hi> and that the Lord did ordain and deſign it to that end and uſe?</p>
               <p>The Anſwer is. We cannot ſafely judg of this but by the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When there is either expreſs Scripture for it. As <hi>Adam</hi> here in the Text is called <hi>a Type of him that was to come:</hi> So the whole Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law is ſaid to have a Shadow of the good things to come under the Goſpel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. The Buildings and holy places of the earthly Temple are ſaid to be Figures of the true, even of Heaven it ſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. The Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Country that <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Fathers ſought for, it is ſaid, <hi>they deſire a better Country, that is, an heavenly, Heb.</hi> 11.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When there is a permutation of Names between the <hi>Type</hi> and the <hi>Antitype,</hi> this is a clear Indication of the Mind of God. As for inſtance, Chriſt is called <hi>David, Ezek.</hi> 34.23. and 37.24. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. this ſhews that <hi>David</hi> was a Type of him, and Chriſt was the true <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Chriſt is called <hi>Adam, the ſecond Adam,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45.</p>
               <p>So he is called <hi>Iſrael, Iſai.</hi> 49.3.</p>
               <p>He is called <hi>that Lamb of God which taketh away the Sins of the World.</hi> Joh. 1.29. <hi>and our Paſſover that is ſacrificed for us,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.7. this ſhews that the Paſchal Lamb was a Type of him.</p>
               <p>He is called <hi>the Bread of Life,</hi> and <hi>the true Bread from Heaven,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96313:39"/>
Joh.</hi> 6.32, 35. this ſhews, that the Manna did relate to him.</p>
               <p>So the Church of the New Teſtament is called <hi>Jeruſalem, Gal.</hi> 4.26. <hi>but</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>which is above is free, which is the Mother of us all</hi> — Rev. 21.2. <hi>I ſaw the new</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>coming down from God out of Heaven.</hi> We may hence conclude that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a Type of the Church.</p>
               <p>So it is ſaid, that the <hi>Odours or Incenſe are the Prayers of the Saints.</hi> Rev. 5.8. Incenſe therefore was a Type of Prayer.</p>
               <p>The Goſpel-Church is called <hi>Iſrael, Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Peace be on them and Mercy, and upon the</hi> Iſrael <hi>of God.</hi> Therefore that People were a Type of the Church of God under the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Goſpel-Miniſters are called the Sons of <hi>Levi, Mal.</hi> 3.3. the Prophet there ſpeaking of the coming of Chriſt, he ſaith, <hi>He ſhall purifie the Sons of</hi> Levi, that is, raiſe up a purer Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more frequent in the Scripture, than for the <hi>Antitype</hi> to be called by the name of the <hi>Type,</hi> and ſometimes on the other ſide, the <hi>Type</hi> bears the Names and Titles belonging in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and more properly to the <hi>Antitype:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Moſes</hi> is called a Mediator, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19.</p>
               <p>So when a Sheep or a Goat is called a Sacrifice, and ſaid to make attonement, or to expiate Sin: there the Work of the <hi>Antitype</hi> is aſcribed unto the <hi>Type</hi> For thoſe things could not take away ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.4. <hi>it is not poſſible, that the Blood of Bulls and Goats ſhould take away ſins:</hi> they were but a ſhadow of a Sacrifice of Chriſt the true Sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When by comparing ſeveral Scriptures together, there doth appear an evident and manifeſt analogy and parallel between things under the Law, and things under the Goſpel, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that ſuch legal Diſpenſations were intended as Types of thoſe Goſpel Myſteries whoſe Image they bear. In ſuch a caſe, <hi>Res ipſa loquitur.</hi> For the <hi>Type</hi> muſt be made like the <hi>Antitype,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of that illuſtrious Type <hi>Melchiſedec, Hebr.</hi> 7.3. <hi>he was made like unto the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> if we read the Hiſtory thereof in the Old Teſtament, and compare it with the Propheſies in the New Teſtament, concerning the Churches Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96313:40"/>
from Antichriſtian Bondage, we ſhall clearly ſee, that it was a Type thereof; there is ſuch a reſemblance, the one anſwers the other ſo remarkably.</p>
               <p>Hence Divines generally make <hi>Sampſon</hi> a Type of Chriſt, there is ſuch a fair and full Analogy in ſundry particulars of his Life and Death between him and Chriſt: So likewiſe <hi>Joſeph</hi> is generally lookt upon as a Type of Chriſt; though there be no Scripture that doth expreſly call him ſo: but if the Hiſtory of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Geneſis</hi> be compared with the Hiſtory of Jeſus Chriſt in the four Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, the Analogy will be very clear and evident.</p>
               <p>The Old Teſtament and the New ſhould be compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The <hi>Protaſis</hi> or Propoſition of theſe ſacred ſimilitudes is in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in the Old Teſtament; but the <hi>Apodoſis,</hi> the Reddition or Application is to be found chiefly in the New.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the <hi>Types</hi> are not ſo explicitly taught, but implyed; and then a thing may be known to be a <hi>Type</hi> by diligent obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and comparing the Phraſe of the Prophets in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the Apoſtles in the New.</p>
               <p>Men muſt not indulge their own Fancies, as the Popiſh Writers uſe to do, with their Allegorical Senſes, as they call them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we have ſome Scripture ground for it. It is not ſafe to make any thing a Type meerly upon our own fanſies and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it is Gods Prerogative to make Types. And ſo much for that firſt Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 2. The Types were not only Signs, but Seals; not only Signs to repreſent Goſpel Myſteries unto them; but alſo Seals to aſſure them of the certain and infallible exhibition thereof in Gods appointed time.</p>
               <p>As we ſay of our Sacraments; <hi>Sacramentum eſt verbum viſibile,</hi> the Sacrament is a viſible Promiſe, and holds forth the Covenant of Grace to the Eye and other Senſes, as the Word to the Ear: ſo it was with the Types of old. The <hi>Types</hi> were viſible Promiſes, and not only Signs, but Pledges and Aſſurances of the good they repreſented. They did repreſent thoſe great Myſteries not only by way of reſemblance to the underſtandings, but by way of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance to the Faith of Gods People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:96313:40"/>Reaſons to prove this, that the Types were Seals.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Apoſtle ſaith it expreſly concerning <hi>Circumciſion, Rom.</hi> 4.11. <hi>he received the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith,</hi> And there is a parity of Reaſon in this reſpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and other <hi>Types.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If they were Signs that did certainly foreſignifie they were Seals. But the <hi>Types</hi> were Signs that did certainly foreſignifie; therefore they were more than Signs, even Seals alſo: They did not ſhew what a one the Meſſiah might happen to be; but what a one he ſhould certainly be: they were ſo many Divine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to the coming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If they were not Seals and Pledges to aſſure, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it would have been no diſappointment to Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and no reflection at all upon his Truth and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if the Meſſiah had been quite another manner of Perſon than the <hi>Types</hi> held forth. But to admit ſuch a ſuppoſition, to ſuppoſe that the Meſſiah might have been quite another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Perſon, than the <hi>Types</hi> hold forth, is to take away the Analogy between the <hi>Type</hi> and the <hi>Antitype;</hi> and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to deny that they were <hi>Types;</hi> or elſe to make them all Lyes and falſe Images. Therefore if it be but granted, that they were true Signs, it follows even from thence, that they were Seals, or ſure and certain Pledges of Chriſt, and Goſpel-Myſteries in him. See <hi>Calvin in</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 11. <hi>Beza in Col.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Erant enim vera &amp; pro ratione ac modo Sacramentorum efficacia</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ac etiam</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. They were both Signs and Seals, and true and efficacious Signs and Seals, after that manner of efficacy that is in Sacraments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 3. The Types relate not only to the Perſon of Chriſt; but to his Benefits, and to all Goſpel Truths and Myſteries, even to all New-Teſtament-Diſpenſations.</p>
               <p>I mention this the rather, becauſe I have obſerved that it doth much darken the thoughts of many, that they ſtudy to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date every <hi>Type</hi> directly to the Perſon of Chriſt; becauſe we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call them Types of Chriſt. But that expreſſion is not meant of his Perſon excluſively to his Benefits; but of both together,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96313:41"/>
Chriſt and the good things of Chriſt: the <hi>Types</hi> ſhadowed forth Chriſt and all the good that comes by him. So the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. <hi>they are a ſhodow of good things, to come;</hi> he doth not limit or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them to the Meſſiahs perſon only. As the <hi>Cherubims were Types,</hi> not directly of Chriſt, but of the Angels that ſtand before the Lord and miniſter to him, and to his People.</p>
               <p>Hence before the Goſpel, there were no Goſpel <hi>Types;</hi> before the firſt Promulgation of it, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3. there could be no <hi>Types</hi> of Goſpel Bleſſings: There were ſome things extant before, which were made <hi>Types</hi> afterwards; but they had not that <hi>Scheſis,</hi> that habitude and relation to Chriſt and the Goſpel, till there was a Goſpel, or a Promiſe of Life by Chriſt, that bleſſed Seed.</p>
               <p>Yea as they had Types of Chriſts Perſon, and of his ſpiritual and ſaving Benefits: ſo they had Types even of all New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Diſpenſations.</p>
               <p>Our very Sacraments were ſhadowed forth by theirs.</p>
               <p>As Baptiſm by Circumciſion, and by their paſſing thorough the Red Sea; and the Lords Supper by their Paſſover.</p>
               <p>Yea they had Types not only of the Bleſſings and Benefits of Chriſt, but of our Miſeries without him.</p>
               <p>As they had their Ceremonial Uncleanneſſes; as the Leproſie, for inſtance, was a Type; Of what? Neither of Chriſt, nor of his Benefits; but of our natural Pollution.</p>
               <p>So they had a Type of the Covenant of Works, <hi>viz. Hagar</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had a Type of the Church of <hi>Rome, viz. Babylon:</hi> So <hi>Antiochus</hi> may paſs for a Type of <hi>Antichriſt. Doeg</hi> and <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi> of <hi>Judas. Pharaoh</hi> for a Type of the <hi>Devil. Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> for a Type of Hell.</p>
               <p>For as the <hi>Types</hi> look chiefly and principally at Chriſt and his Benefits, in the clear and full Exhibition and Communication of them under the Goſpel: ſo they repreſent other things alſo, though not by way of Primacy and principal intention; but by way of concomitancy and illuſtration of the Principal.</p>
               <p>Therefore theſe Types of New-Teſtament-evils, it will not be neceſſary always to handle them by themſelves: For the moſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:96313:41"/>
of them will come in better under the ſeveral Types or Shadows of good things, the further illuſtration whereof by the contrary was the thing chiefly aimed at in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 4. As there is a Similitude, a Reſemblance and Analogy between the Type and the Antitype in ſome things: ſo there is ever a diſſimilitude and a diſparity between them in other things. It is ſo in all ſimilitudes.</p>
               <p>It is a Rule in Reaſon. There is a mixture of Conſentaneity and Diſſentaneity; or elſe inſtead of Similitude, there would be Identity.</p>
               <p>So here in theſe ſacred Similies, it is not to be expected that the <hi>Type</hi> and the <hi>Antitype</hi> ſhould <hi>quadrare per omnia,</hi> that they ſhould agree in all things.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Apoſtle, though he makes <hi>Adam a Type of Chriſt,</hi> whom he calls the <hi>ſecond Adam;</hi> yet he ſhews the diſparity alſo, and that <hi>the ſecond Adam</hi> did infinitely tranſcend and excel <hi>the firſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.47. <hi>the firſt man is of the Earth earthly, the ſecond man is the Lord from Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Prieſts of old, they were Types of Chriſt; but Chriſt did infinitely excel them, and his Prieſthood was infinitely more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as the Apoſtle diſputes at large in the 7, 8, 9, and 10. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſee particularly chap. 7. v. 23, 24, 27.</p>
               <p>There is more in the <hi>Antitype,</hi> than in the <hi>Type.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hom. 61. in Geneſ.</note> 
                  <hi>Opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet figuram minus habere quam veritatem, Chryſoſt.</hi> For ſuch is the Glory and Excellency of Chriſt the <hi>Antitype,</hi> that no <hi>Type</hi> could reach it.</p>
               <p>Hence that Diſtinction of <hi>Types partial,</hi> and <hi>Types total,</hi> muſt be underſtood with ſome limitation thus; That ſome things or perſons were only Types of Chriſt in ſome one particular thing, others in many things: but there never was any that did, or could poſſibly reſemble him perfectly in all things.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Jonas</hi> is called <hi>a partial Type,</hi> becauſe he ſhadowed forth the Meſſiah in that one thing, his abiding two or three days in the Grave, and then riſing again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David,</hi> ſome call him <hi>a total Type,</hi> in regard that the whole Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Life hath ſo great a ſhadow and repreſentaton of Chriſt the true <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:96313:42"/>But yet, if we ſpeak rigidly and properly, <hi>David</hi> himſelf was <hi>but a partial Type.</hi> For he was only a Prophet and a King; he was not a Prieſt; but Chriſt was both Prophet, Prieſt and King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed was both a Prophet, a Prieſt, and a King; but his Prieſthood continued only till <hi>Aaron</hi> was conſecrated, then <hi>Moſes</hi> laid it down.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Moſes</hi> did mediate between God and the People as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, to interpret the Mind of God to them; and as a King or a Judg to govern them, and as an Interceſſor to pray for them; but not by giving himſelf a Sacrifice unto death for expiation of their ſins: He was a Mediator <hi>ob interpretandi &amp; docendi officium;</hi> but not <hi>ob ſatisfaciendi beneficium,</hi> as ſome expreſs it.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf was <hi>but a partial Type,</hi> a Type only <hi>ratione rei</hi> in regard of Redemption and Deliverance; but not <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione modi;</hi> he did not do it by ſhedding his Blood, and laying down his Life as Chriſt did.</p>
               <p>Hence we muſt take heed of ſtraining the Types too far, to make them agree in that wherein indeed there is a diſparity or diſagreement: If the Type go with us one mile, or rather with the Antitype one mile, we muſt not conſtrain it to go twain.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing propounded to be ſpoken to, was the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and Agreements between a Type and other things of like nature: that ſo we may diſtinguiſh and diſcern the things that differ.</p>
               <p>I ſhall inſtance here only in four things that are partly of the ſame nature with the Types, but yet not exactly the ſame.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The difference between a Type and a Simile.</p>
               <p>A Type doth belong indeed to that Argument or Notion in Logick; but with this difference, this diſtinction will ſhew you the difference between them; that there is <hi>Typus arbitrarius</hi> and <hi>Typus fixus &amp; inſtitutus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An arbitrary Type is a ſimilitude or compariſon.</p>
               <p>So Marriage is a ſimilitude or compariſon, by which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſets out the myſtical union between Chriſt and the Church, <hi>Epheſ. 5.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet Marriage is not a Type. For then we ſhall make it a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96313:42"/>
Sacrament, as the Papiſts do: you know it was inſtituted for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end before the Goſpel came into the world: It is a Sign, but not a Sacrament. For by that Argument we ſhould have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Sacraments.</p>
               <p>So Riders on white Horſes are reſemblances uſed in Scripture to ſet out Chriſt and the Angels; but yet not properly Types of them: And the reaſon is this, becauſe they were never inſtituted and deſigned by God for that end, to repreſent Chriſt and the Goſpel; they are only occaſionally made uſe of.</p>
               <p>There is a wide difference between the occaſional uſe of a thing in the way of a ſimilitude or compariſon, and the Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Inſtitution of it for that end and uſe.</p>
               <p>As if Chriſt be compared to a Feaſt of Bread and Wine, as in the Parable of the Marriage-Supper. This is a very true and fit compariſon: but for Bread and Wine to be deſigned and ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by the Command of God to repreſent Chriſt and his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, this is a thing of an higher nature, and puts them into a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental nature and relation to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The difference between a Type and a Parable.</p>
               <p>A Parable is nothing elſe but a ſacred Similitude: We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly take it as the Scripture doth, for ſuch a ſimilitude wherein not only the Truth and Mind of God is the ſcope and matter of it; but whereof God himſelf is the Author. As in the four Evangeliſts we read of the Parables of Chriſt. To call them Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as <hi>Grotius</hi> doth, <hi>haec Fabula indicat, &amp;c.</hi> is a ſlight and an irreverent expreſſion.</p>
               <p>A Parable there is the ſame with a Similitude, only hath God himſelf for its Author. But in a Type the Lord doth not only occaſionally uſe ſuch or ſuch a ſimile; but ſets ſuch a thing apart, ſets a ſtamp of Inſtitution upon it, and ſo makes it an Ordinance to hold forth Chriſt and his Benefits.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What is the difference between a Type and a Ceremony? This is only that which is between the <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species.</hi> For all the Ceremonies were Types; but all Types were not Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: The Pillar of Cloud and Fire was a Type, but not a Ceremony.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:96313:43"/>A Ceremony was ſome Law, or external Obſervation preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, to teach and ſhadow forth ſome Goſpel-Myſtery: ſo that a Type is more general, a Ceremony is one particular kind of Types.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What is the difference between a Type and a Sacrament? I anſwer, they differed in the number and multitude of them, they had many Types, we have but two Sacraments. But there was no difference in the nature of them, further than this, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are Signs of Chriſt already <hi>come;</hi> but their Types were Signs of Chriſt that was for to come: our Sacraments are Signs <hi>Chriſti exhibiti;</hi> their Types <hi>Chriſti exhibendi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. As to the Words and Phraſes by which it is expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we have this very word <hi>Type</hi> uſed in the Scripture, not only in its native and proper Sgnification, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.25. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>It is not good to deſpiſe any part of Scripture knowledg, much leſs ſuch parts as ſtand in ſuch a direct relation to Jeſus Chriſt. Though there is ſomething of difficulty through our own dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and weakneſs; yet the fruit will countervail the pains and labour; though they be difficult, yet they are uſeful to be known.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have been deſired by my Brethren of the Miniſtry to ſpeak unto them, and I hope to receive aſſiſtance from God through your Prayers: and I do much deſire the help of your Prayers, that you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me to the Lord, that he would carry me through this work, that he would enlighten and enable me by his Spirit, to ſpeak unto them with clear light; and not only ſo as may be clear and convincing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96313:44"/>
to my own Conſcience and Judgment; but with ſuch evidence of light, as may be ſatisfying and illuminating to yours alſo, even in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and demonſtration of his Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some have not unfitly called the Ceremonial Law one of the richeſt Cabinets of Divinity, full of ineſtimable Jewels. But many things in their Religion will ſeem ſtrange, and uncouth, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, if we conſider them without their ſcope and meaning.</p>
               <p>All the Ceremonial Law, if a man knows not the meaning of it, looks like an heap of unprofitable Burthens. The Temple appears but like a Shambles, or Butchers Slaughter houſe; and the Prieſthood a vain &amp; uſeleſs Occupation: but conſider them in their ſenſe and meaning and every thing is full of Light and Glory.</p>
               <p>A great part of the Scripture, eſpecially the old Teſtament, <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Leviticus</hi> and other places will be like a Sealed Book unto you, if you have not ſome inſight into the <hi>Types.</hi> But if the Lord give you a little inſight into them, you will read the Old Teſtament with more profit and ſpiritual underſtanding. For the Prophets do comment upon them; yea ſo do the Apoſtles alſo: and indeed the whole New Teſtament is a large and full Expoſition of the <hi>Types.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you ask, how may we ſo ſearch and look into them, as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, and profit by them?</p>
               <p>Take but three Rules for this, and I conclude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 1. Search the Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. <hi>for they are they which teſtifie of me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt): the Scripture is the beſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of it ſelf. We cannot judg of theſe legal Shadows but by Scripture-light. If either expreſs words, or change of Names, or a clear analogy and proportion do appear; theſe are Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Mind of God, that ſuch things are <hi>Types.</hi> Go no further than we ſee the Scripture going before us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 2. Study the Covenant of Grace. <hi>Faedus gratiae clavis totius Scripturae.</hi> Look diligently into the Goſpel, get a clear and ſpiritual inſight and underſtanding into that; this is the beſt help to the underſtanding of the <hi>Types.</hi> For he that well underſtands the <hi>Antitype,</hi> will more eaſily and readily diſcern the analogy, and ſee the reſemblance it hath with the <hi>Type.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:96313:44"/>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 3. As you find the Lord letting in any thing of further light into your minds, be ſure you act Faith, and exerciſe Grace with renewed vigour upon thoſe Truths and Myſteries, as you find any Beams of further Light coming in concerning them.</p>
               <p>If a man have all Knowledg, and underſtood all Myſteries, and hath not Fath and Love, what is he the better for his Light? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12.</p>
               <p>When you ſee things more clearly and fully, you ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to believe more ſtrongly, and to grow in Grace, as you grow in Light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why the Lord ſpake ſo much in this way by Types and Shadows?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Something may be gathered as to this, out of what was formerly ſpoken in general concerning the Reaſons of the Lords uſing ſo great variety of Diſpenſation, from that Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. therefore I ſhall but touch upon ſome few things now, and that very briefly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 1. There is a general ſuitableneſs in ſuch a way of ſpeaking unto mans Nature, as a ſenſitive Creature, conſiſting of a Body as well as a Soul.</p>
               <p>Hence in all times and ages, even before Sin entred, the Lord gave unto mankind ſome outward and ſenſible things to be Signs and Repreſentations of ſpiritual things: Hence were theſe two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Trees, the Tree of Life, and the Tree of Knowledg of good and evil.</p>
               <p>And now much more ſince the Fall; Man being fallen much lower, hath greater need of ſuch Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>Man is not only a ſenſitive, but a ſenſe loving Creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 2. It was particularly ſuitable to that Infant age and ſtate of the Church: it was ſuitable to their Nonage, to be taught by ſuch viſible and carnal things.</p>
               <p>The whole way of Gods Diſpenſations,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Galv. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit. l. 2. c. 11. ſ. 1, 11.</note> both Gods Bleſſings and Judgments were much more external and ſenſible than they are now.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:96313:45"/>Children muſt have their A. B. C. weak and rudimental In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. Theſe are called Elements, or Rudiments, yea <hi>weak and beggarly Rudiments</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tota legis Oeconomia veluti rudis quaedam erat diſciplina rudibus conveniens. Beza in Gal.</hi> 4.3. Like a Horn-book to a Child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 3. That they to whom it was not given might not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 4. That his People might ſoe and underſtand the better.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Reaſons are aſſigned by Chriſt himſelf for his own teaching ſo much by Parables; and there is ſome affinity between a Type and a Parable, as you heard the laſt time, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.11, 13. <hi>why ſpeakeſt thou to them in Parables?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe it is given to you to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and — <hi>becauſe they ſeeing ſee not, &amp;c.</hi> Similitudes not underſtood are Riddles and clouds of Darkneſs upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; But if once interpreted and underſtood, they are like bright Candles, they give a clear light. <hi>Comparata etiam ficta arguunt, fidemque faciunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not a true and ſound Rule, that of the Schoolmen, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia ſymbolica non eſt argumentativa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What! ſhall we ſay, that all the Parables of our Saviour did argue nothing? when indeed they did not only argue, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate; and that ſo, as did convince and cut the hearts ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of his greateſt enemies and oppoſers.</p>
               <p>Was not <hi>Nathans</hi> Parable argumentative, yea demonſtrative and convicting unto <hi>David?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Rule may be true concerning their own allegorical Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and myſtical Froth, which may be found in their Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: but concerning <hi>Scripture-Types</hi> it is moſt falſe.</p>
               <p>You have ſeen the Nature of a Type, what it is, and ſome ſhort hints of reaſons of the Lords ſpeaking this way: we ſhall now enter into particulars, and go through the <hi>Types,</hi> and open to you (as the Lord ſhall enable) ſomething of the Goſpel-Truths and Myſteries adumbrated and ſhadowed forth by them; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the help and aſſiſtance of him, of whom we are to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:96313:45"/>Now the firſt and moſt general Diſtribution of them is into <hi>Types perſonal</hi> and <hi>Types real,</hi> holy perſons and holy things. The terms of which diſtinction are ſo plain, that it needs no further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; therefore we ſhall not make any tarrying here: you know the difference between perſons and things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perſonal Types</hi> are ſuch as <hi>Adam, Noah, David,</hi> and others.</p>

                  <hi>Real Types</hi> are the <hi>Temple,</hi> the <hi>Ark,</hi> the <hi>Manna,</hi> the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and ſuch like, whereof hereafter.</p>
               <p>We ſhall begin with the <hi>perſonal Types:</hi> and they may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided into two ſorts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Individual Perſons.</item>
                  <item>2. Typical Ranks and Orders of Perſons, which we may call Religious Orders; ſuch as the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> the <hi>Nazarites, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Typical individual Perſons. Concerning theſe there be ſome previous Rules, that may be of ſome uſe, and give ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Light for your better underſtanding of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were all godly men. No wicked man, individually conſidered, ever was, or could be a Type of Chriſt. How could Limbs of the Devil, men in whom <hi>Satan</hi> dwelt, be Pictures as it were and Looking-glaſſes, in which to ſee the Shadow of the moſt high God, who is Holineſs it ſelf.</p>
               <p>A man perſonally wicked may be involved with others in a religious Order. For the Order is holy, though the man be wicked; But if ſingle perſons be Types, they muſt needs be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas theſe holy men had their failings; They were not Types of Chriſt in regard of their ſinful failings; but only in their Graces and Excellencies. For Sin cannot be a Type of Holineſs: Therein they were not like; but unlike to Jeſus Chriſt the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. When Typical perſons had real Types belonging to them (as oftentimes they had) we ſhall ſpeak to both together, at leaſt where they cannot be better and more conveniently referred to ſome other place.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance, <hi>Noahs Ark</hi> was a Type, as well as he himſelf. Therefore we ſhall ſpeak to that, when we ſpeak of <hi>Noah,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96313:46"/>
a Circumſtance, and a part of his Hiſtory, which was though a true and real, yet withal a typical Hiſtory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe typical perſons, the higheſt and moſt eminent of them, were but partial Types: Therefore together with the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy between them and the Antitype, we ſhall ſometimes, where we ſee it needful, note alſo the diſparity and diſproportion that was between them. That you may ſee how far the Shadows fell ſhort of the Subſtance, and how the <hi>Antitype</hi> excels the <hi>Type.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we ſhall not mention all, but only ſome of the chief and moſt illuſtrious.</p>
               <p>And becauſe there be divers of them, we ſhall rank them, for method and memories ſake, into two Claſſes.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The perſonal Types that were before the Law.</item>
                  <item>2. Under the Law.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Before the Law. Here I ſhall inſtance only in eight Perſons, namely, <hi>Adam, Enoch, Noah, Melchizedek, Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Adam.</hi> He was <hi>the firſt Type of Chriſt</hi> in the world.</p>
               <p>That he was a Type of Chriſt is clear from expreſs Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The Text, <hi>Rom</hi> 5.14. <hi>Who is the Type of him that was to come,</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. <hi>The firſt man</hi> Adam <hi>was made a living Soul, the laſt</hi> Adam <hi>was made a quickening Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to ſhew you the Analogy, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> did reſemble and repreſent the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It was chiefly in this. In regard of his Headſhip and Influence, <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt both ſtood inſtead of all that belonged to them. <hi>Adam</hi> was the Head of the firſt Covenant, Jeſus Chriſt is the Head of the ſecond Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> was the Covenant-root and Head of all Mankind, a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and common perſon, repreſenting them; yea an undertaker for them.</p>
               <p>What they ſay vainly of the Pope, that he is the Church-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, may be truly ſaid of <hi>Adam;</hi> He was the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of the whole World, as a Parliament-man acting in the name of the Town or Country that choſe him: He ſinning, we ſinned in him; he being condemned, we are condemned in him:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:96313:46"/>So Chriſt is the Head of the ſecond Covenant, and of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, who are involved and wrapt up therein: He hath underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for them, and preſented them to the Father, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.16. <hi>in one body:</hi> Therefore when he died we died with him; when Chriſt was crucified, our Sins were nailed to his Croſs, and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and buried as it were in his Grave. If he ariſe, we riſe with him, to die no more. His Influence is to all his Seed. For both <hi>Adams</hi> have a Seed. As <hi>Adam:</hi> ſo Chriſt. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.10. <hi>He ſhall ſee his Seed</hi>— He communicates to them what he hath: ſo doth Chriſt what he hath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> conveys and communicates Sin and Death: But Chriſt Righteouſneſs and Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> brought in theſe two great Intruders and Uſurpers, Sin and Death, into the world.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Adam</hi> conveys Sin to thoſe that had not ſinned actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: ſo doth Chriſt convey Righteouſneſs to thoſe that had not wrought Righteouſneſs. As in the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.30, 31. <hi>The Gentiles, which followed not after Righteouſneſs, have attained to Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as there is an Union between Soul and Body, <hi>Adams</hi> Sin is imputed to his Seed: ſo as ſoon as there is a myſtical Union between Chriſt and the Soul by the Spirit of Faith, ſo ſoon is Chriſts Righteouſneſs imputed.</p>
               <p>There be ſome other Conſiderations may be added unto theſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle ſeems to make his Dominion over the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures a ſhadow of Chriſts Dominion and Kingdom, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.19, 20. Pſal. 8.6. compar'd with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His Relation to <hi>Eve.</hi> She was taken out of his Side while <hi>Adam</hi> was aſleep, and afterwards married to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.21. ſo the Church is taken out of Chriſts Side, while he was in the ſleep of Death, and joyned to him as his Spouſe by the Covenant of Grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one Husband, that I may preſent you as a chaſt Virgin to Chriſt.</hi> Epheſ. 5.30, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>1. <hi>We are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones</hi>— While Chriſt dies, his Church receives Life, and ſhe which lives only by him, her hath he eſpouſed to himſelf <hi>in Truth, Mercy and Righteouſneſs,</hi> Hoſ. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:96313:47"/>The Church is both <hi>Effectum &amp; Objectum Redemptionis,</hi> the Effect and the Object of Redemption.</p>
               <p>The Effect. He died to purchaſe to himſelf a Church, a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p>The Object. He gave himſelf for the Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25.</p>
               <p>But yet it follows not, that Marriage is a Sacrament, though <hi>Adams</hi> Marriage had ſuch a ſacramental or typical notion put upon it, he being the common Root of all mankind: But this will not ſuffice to make Marriage a Sacrament, no more than the annexing a typical uſe to the Jewiſh Sabbath, <hi>viz.</hi> to commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> will make the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment ceremonial.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Adam</hi> was a Type of Chriſt: ſo we may carry the parallel a little further.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Eve</hi> may be conſidered as a Type of the Church. For the Godly are called her Seed, <hi>I will put enmity between thy Seed,</hi> that is, the Serpents, <hi>and her Seed.</hi> Gen. 3.15. and <hi>Adam</hi> calls her <hi>the Mother of all living,</hi> Gen. 3.20. So <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above, that is, the Church, <hi>is the Mother of us all,</hi> Gal. 4.26.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, as <hi>Adam</hi> was a Type himſelf; ſo he had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Types belonging to him.</p>
               <p>There were divers real Types belonging to the Hiſtory of this perſonal Type.</p>
               <p>As Paradiſe a Type of Heaven. For Heaven is often called by that name, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. that which in ver. 2. is called the <hi>third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> is called in ver. 4. <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.43. <hi>this day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Paradiſe was a Garden of Pleaſure. <hi>Eden</hi> from whence the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Pleaſure: and the Heatheniſh Poems of the Gardens of <hi>Adonis:</hi> But at thy right hand in Heaven are Pleaſures for evermore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the Tree of Life in Paradiſe was a Type of Chriſt, though it was created upon the third day of the Week; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel it could not be a Type of Chriſt; yet after the Fall, and after the preaching of the Goſpel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. it might be deſigned and ordained to this uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:96313:47"/>As God provided Phyſical Herbs for Man before he fell, or needed them as to that uſe of Phyſick: ſo this Tree of Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sin, or the Goſpel was known; It ſeems to be ſo ſpoken of <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.7. and 22.2. <hi>The Tree of Life in the midſt of Paradiſe.</hi> Chriſt in the midſt of the Church.</p>
               <p>Mans Ejection out of Paradiſe, a Type of his deſerved Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion out of Heaven.</p>
               <p>And the Cherubims with flaming Swords, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and viſible ſhadow of the Wrath of God; and of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God as Executioners of it on Man, who were created to be Miniſters to his good, and are ſo again through Grace: But, as in our natural condition, they are the Lords Hoſts to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</p>
               <p>But there is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a much more put upon Chriſt. His ſaving Virtue far exceeds that curſed influence of <hi>Adam,</hi> in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry particulars, amply opened by the Apoſtle from ver. 12. to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The diſparity is very great both in their Perſons. <hi>The firſt</hi> Adam <hi>is of the earth earthly;</hi> his Name is but <hi>Adam,</hi> Earth, or Red earth; <hi>but the ſecond</hi> Adam <hi>is the Lord from Heaven,</hi> 2 Cor. 15.47</p>
               <p n="2">2. In their Headſhip and Undertaking, the one of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works; the other of a better Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the Succeſs of their Undertakings. The one failed; the other kept the Covenant; the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was tempted by Satan, and conquered by him; but Chriſt was tempted, but overcame the Tempter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In their Influences. <hi>The firſt</hi> Adam <hi>was made a living Soul; the ſecond a quickening Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.45. The one conveys all evil, Sin and Death to his Seed: the other communicates all good, Righteouſneſs and Life to his. There is Righteouſneſs oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Sin, and Life to Death, and with a much more, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>Not as the Offence, ſo is the free Gift.</hi> At the great Day, when <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall ſee his Seed loſt and undone, he muſt own it. I have embrued my hands in the Blood of all theſe: But Chriſt ſhall ſay, here am I, and the Children which God hath given me, and not one of them is loſt.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:96313:48"/>2. <hi>Enoch,</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, he is not ſo expreſly mentioned in Scripture for a Type of Chriſt, as <hi>Adam</hi> is; but yet by comparing the Scriptures we may diſcern a clear analogy between Chriſt and him; how he was made like unto the Son of God in ſundry things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He was a moſt illuſtrious Type of Chriſts Aſcenſion into Heaven, and indeed the only Type they had of it before the Law. They had but two in all; <hi>Elijah</hi> under the Law, and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> before the Law: Therefore we cannot well omit him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24. Enoch <hi>walked with God, and he was not: for God took him;</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. <hi>he was tranſlated, that he ſhould not ſee Death, and was not found, becauſe God had tranſlated him.</hi> Some look upon this as a pledg of their Tranſlation that ſhall be found alive at Chriſts ſecond coming; of whom the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>they ſhall be changed,</hi> or tranſlated, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. But it looks firſt and chiefly at Chriſt himſelf, at his Aſcenſion. This I mention firſt, as being the chief particular: but a further analogy may obſerved in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other particulars alſo; as,</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was in <hi>Enoch</hi> ſome ſhadow of Chriſts Prophetical Office; we read of <hi>Enochs</hi> Propheſie, <hi>Jude</hi> 14, 15.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt is the true Prophet, who hath unſealed the whole Book of Gods Counſels, that <hi>Liber fatidicus, Rev.</hi> 5. he hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened it ſo far as is fit and needful for his Church to know.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Enoch</hi> propheſied of the Day of Judgment: ſo hath Chriſt very fully and frequently.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may ſet him among the Types of Chriſt for his unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell'd Holineſs in the age wherein he lived, which was a corrupt and evil time, <hi>all Fleſh began to corrupt their way,</hi> Gen. 5.22, 24. <hi>Enoch walked with God;</hi> it is twice repeated, as worthy of ſpecial remark: ſo Chriſt <hi>fulfilled all Righteouſneſs,</hi> Matth. 3.15.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His pleaſing God. For ſo it is teſtified of him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. ſo Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. <hi>this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed — Joh.</hi> 8.29. <hi>I do always thoſe things that pleaſe him.</hi> He is pleaſed ſo well with him, that he is well pleaſed with Sinners for his ſake, even for his Righteouſneſs ſake.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His very Name <hi>Enoch</hi> hath ſomething in it, <hi>dedicated unto
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96313:48"/>
God.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Some have added, in regard of the continuance of his Life. <hi>Henochs</hi> days were as the days of the Sun. For he lived <hi>three hundred ſixty five years,</hi> Gen. 5.24. as many years as there be days in the year.</p>
               <p>And of Chriſt it is is ſaid, <hi>his Throne ſhall continue for ever, as the Sun before me,</hi> Pſal. 89.36.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third typical perſon that we mentioned is <hi>Noah.</hi> He is made a <hi>Type,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20, 21. in regard of his preaching and ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe that believed him in the Ark.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt hath publiſhed the Goſpel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. <hi>no man knoweth the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son revealeth him — He came and preached Peace,</hi> Epheſ. 2.17. 1 Pet. 3.19. Chriſt preached in <hi>Noah:</hi> he ſaves them that believe his Doctrine; he ſaves them in the Ark of his Church, by the Covenant and Water of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was alſo a Type of Chriſt; and moſt eſpecially in regard of the excellency and eternity of his Perſon, Prieſthood and Kingdom. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110 4. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, thou art a Prieſt for ever after the Order of</hi> Melchizedek, with <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.2, 3, 4. <hi>made like unto the Son of God.</hi> But there is not time to inſiſt upon theſe, nor to proceed to the reſt of the Types.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore for the preſent conclude with ſomething of Uſe and practical Improvement; and ſhall raiſe the Uſes not ſo much from the Doctrine in general; but rather from that which hath been ſpoken upon it at this time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Learn and know ſomething more of Jeſus Chriſt by what you have heard; or, if you knew it before, let it be more deeply imprinted upon your hearts.</p>
               <p>Let us ſum up all together: for they are all but <hi>partial Types,</hi> and weak and imperfect Shadows of the Meſſiah: but all put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96313:49"/>
will give the greater luſtre; like the <hi>Galaxia,</hi> which is ſaid to be a multitude of little Stars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> was a Type of Chriſt in regard of his Headſhip and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; <hi>Enoch</hi> a Type of his Aſcenſion into Heaven; <hi>Noah</hi> of his Preaching and ſaving the Church by the Covenant and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Baptiſm; <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was a Shadow of the Excellency and Eternity of his Perſon, and of his Prieſthood and Kingdom. Know theſe things, meditate and conſider them more throughly, and improve Chriſt in theſe Diſcoveries for your ſpiritual good. Conſider him as a common perſon ſtanding in our ſtead, as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Prieſt and King; as aſcended into Heaven, as the Saviour of the Church, which is his Body.</p>
               <p>Uſe 2. Be exhorted to examine your ſelves, and try which of the <hi>two Adams</hi> you are under. For there are but two Men in the World, the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Adam;</hi> thou art a Member of one of them. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> divide the whole World.</p>

               <p n="1">1. What Birth haſt thou? only the natural, or ſpiritual Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? Art thou only born, or new born?

               </p>
               <p>What Experience haſt thou had of this great work? <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> though a Doctor in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> underſtood little of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What Covenant doth thy Soul cleave to, and act under the rule and influence of? Works or Grace?</p>
               <p>Works is the <hi>firſt Adams</hi> Covenant: but Grace is the Covenant of the <hi>ſecond Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To go forth in a mans own Strength, to expect acceptance in his own Worth, this is a firſt Covenant Spirit; a ſign thou grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt upon the old Stock, upon the root of <hi>old Adam:</hi> But to live in a continual dependance upon free Grace for every thing, the free Grace of God in Chriſt: this is the Spirit of the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and becomes the Sons and Branches of the <hi>ſecond Adam.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:96313:49"/>Though a godly man may for a fit turn aſide to the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did to <hi>Hagar;</hi> yet it is not his way, it is not his Spirit to do ſo; and thence he is never at reſt, till he return to have his dependance and reſt on Chriſt again: The Spirit of one under the Covenant of Grace is, <hi>to have no confidence in the Fleſh; but to have his reſt and rejoycing in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3.3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What Communications, whoſe Influences doſt thou receive? Every Branch receives from its Root, the Stream from its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.

               <p n="1">1. Thou art here upon Earth; Chriſt the Head in Heaven, but his poor Saints and Members here below: But remember whither Jeſus the Forerunner is entred for us. As ſure as <hi>Enochs</hi> Body is in Heaven, or <hi>Elijahs,</hi> by the virtue of his Aſcenſion, of whom they were Shadows: ſo ſure ſhall thine and mine aſcend thither, if we be his, though we ſleep in the duſt for a time, as Chirſt himſelf alſo did.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But while in this low valley, the floods of great Waters are ready to overwhelm us; the floods of Perſecution, Affliction, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, the overflowing ſcourges of common calamities, which puts many of Gods people to ſome cares and fears: But as to this, conſider that <hi>true Noah;</hi> the Lord provides an Ark of ſafety for his people, <hi>that the floods of great Waters may not overwhelm them,</hi> Pſal. 32.6— ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 124.1-5. <hi>If it had not been the Lord

who was on our ſide— if it had not been the Lord who was on our ſide, when Men roſe up againſt us: then the Waters had overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, the Stream had gone over our Soul— then the proud Waters had gone over our Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 3. Thou art a poor unworthy creature, and God is angry, or appears angry; and how can I expect ſuch Salvation from him, who have ſinned againſt him ſo as I have done? To this, remember what an High Prieſt you have, even Jeſus, who is made an High Prieſt for ever, after the Order of <hi>Melchizedek: Therefore let us come with boldneſs to the Throne of Grace.</hi> It is the Apoſtles Inference, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15, 16. the Apoſtle ſaith of <hi>Melchizedek, Heb.</hi> 7.4. <hi>conſider how great this man was.</hi> It may be ſaid much more of Chriſt, conſider how great your High Prieſt is.</p>
               <p>How little ſoever thou art in thy own eyes, how unworthy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; the Greatneſs and Glory of your Redeemer is enough to remove all diſcouragement.</p>
               <p>Some entrance (Beloved) hath been made into the <hi>perſonal Types.</hi> We are upon the individual perſons that were Types before the Law, whereof eight were named, <hi>Adam, Enoch, Noah, Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek, Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> whereof only two have been ſpoken to, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſecondly <hi>Enoch.</hi> We ſhall now proceed to the reſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is <hi>Noah,</hi> whom we did but touch upon the laſt time, but ſhall endeavour now to clear it more fully.</p>
               <p>The Story of <hi>Noah</hi> is written in the 6, 7, 8, and 9. Chapters of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> And ſo famous it was amongſt his Poſterity, that the Heathen have ſome broken Remembrances and Traditions of it; they had heard of a Flood, as well as of the Creation of the World. <hi>Ovid</hi> ſpeaks of them both in his <hi>Metamorphoſis:</hi> And their <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the very name with a little alteration of the Letters, comes from <hi>Noah Noachus, Boachus,</hi> and <hi>Janus,</hi> from the <hi>Hebrew Jajin vinum:</hi> ſomewhat they had heard, as it ſeemeth, about his planting a Vinyard, and making Wine.</p>
               <p>That this Hiſtory of <hi>Noah</hi> had a typical reſpect, you may ſee in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20, 21.</p>

                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:96313:50"/>In what reſpect was he a Type? In two things chiefly.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In regard of his Preaching.</item>
                  <item>2. His ſaving his Houſhold in the Ark.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of his Preaching; he was a Preacher of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. he gave warning to the ſecure World for a hundred and twenty years together, both by his Word and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Every ſtroke in the building of the Ark had a voice, and was an alarm to the World every day:</p>
               <p>So Chriſt, who did preach by his Spirit in the Miniſtry of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, 20. And when he came in the Fleſh, <hi>he did preach, and bring in everlaſting Righteouſneſs,</hi> Dan. 9.24. And he hath preached by his Word and Spirit in his Apoſtles and Miniſters ever ſince.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Noah</hi> did one hundred and twenty years, Chriſt hath been doing theſe ſixteen hundred years.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Noah</hi> had no great ſucceſs in his Miniſtry: ſo Chriſt and all the Servants of Chriſt have cauſe to complain, <hi>who hath believed our Report,</hi> Iſai. 53.1.</p>
               <p>There were but eight perſons ſaved in the Ark, <hi>wherein a few, that is, eight Souls were ſaved by Water,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. And of thoſe eight, all were not ſaved eternally; there was a <hi>Cham,</hi> and of him the curſed <hi>Canaanites:</hi> but all the reſt of the world periſhed in the Flood. Doubtleſs they deſpiſed <hi>Noah</hi> and all his Preaching, and thought him an old doting Fool to go and build a Ship on dry ground, and expect that the Sea ſhould come up thither to ſet it afloat; they would not believe one word he ſaid: ſo men account Preaching Fooliſhneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. Hence thoſe complaints of Chriſt and his Meſſengers, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.4. <hi>I have laboured in vain, I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought, and in vain</hi>— In his own perſonal Miniſtry and teaching we read not of very many that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by him.</p>
               <p>To the Apoſtles he gave more ſucceſs; but yet the converted ones were but a few in compariſon of the unconverted, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Noah</hi> was a Type of Chriſt in regard of his ſaving thoſe that did believe his Preaching, from the common Deluge and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:96313:51"/>Hence the Notation of his Name <hi>Noah;</hi> it ſignifies Reſt: Chriſt is Reſt, and the only Reſt of the Soul, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.30. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.29. <hi>He ſhall comfott us, becauſe of the Curſe laid upon the Earth.</hi> Not upon the Earth only, (as the blind Papiſts dream, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore love the Fiſh better than the Fleſh;) but the Earth is put for the whole Creation. The Earth, the Sea, and all the Elemens, and all that is therein: yea the Sun, Moon and Stars are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded out of the general Curſe and Bondage of the Creatures: the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the whole Creation ſuffers and groans,</hi> Rom. 8.22.</p>
               <p>The ancient Dominion over the Creatures was in part reſtored, when they came together peaceably in the Ark: the firſt Bleſſing of Propagation and Dominion had its Charter renewed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.9. Now <hi>Noah</hi> was an Inſtrument to remove this Curſe in part, to repair the Ruines of the old World, and reſtore it to a better ſtate: Some he did ſave out of the common Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. ſo doth Chriſt reſtore and ſave loſt and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Mankind, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. by the Reſurrection of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This being a main thing wherein <hi>Noah</hi> was a Shadow, let us inquire and ſearch into it more fully: For where the Scripture gives us a general hint, that ſuch a thing was a Type, we may ſafely inquire; yea, we ought to inquire, and ſearch out the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars wherein the Analogy lies.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The Ark was a Type of the Church. Some have accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated the Ark as a Type a little otherwiſe; but this is the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. The Analogy may be made out in many particulars, which ſome have done with much ingenuity, which becauſe it ſeems to be ſolid as well as ingenious, I ſhall rehearſe it to you: I ſay the Analogy may appear in theſe ten particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Noah</hi> builded the Ark according to the Mind of God, and he was in it himſelf when it was toſſed, and floated upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.22. <hi>according to all that God commanded, ſo did he.</hi> So Chriſt buildeth the Church in perfect Faithfulneſs to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Will, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>He was faithful to him that appointed him, as alſo</hi> Moſes <hi>was faithful in all his Houſe:</hi> and he is in it, in all the Floods and Troubles of his Church and People to the end of the world, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.2. <hi>when thou paſſeſt through the Waters, I will be with thee.</hi> Matth. 28.20. <hi>Lo, I am with you alway even to the end of the world.</hi> The Church is reſembled by a Ship: ſo <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.11. <hi>O thou toſſed with Tempeſts.</hi> Here the Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Ship in a Storm: and there are many things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Ship, reſembling ſomewhat in the Church.</p>
               <p>The Pump Repentance.</p>
               <p>The Sails Affections.</p>
               <p>Wind the Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Rudder the Word—</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Workmen and Carpenters that built it, they were drowned themſelves: ſo carnal Miniſters may be inſtrumental for good to others, of ſaving others, and yet not not ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>It is a ſcruple which ſome Chriſtians are exerciſed with, the Miniſter by whom they have received good to their Soules proves an Apoſtate; hence they queſtion the Work they have found by his Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Now I confeſs, that ordinarily God doth not bleſs the Labours of wicked Miniſters; but yet ſometimes he doth: as in the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96313:52"/>
of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, many had to do with it, who were not truly godly: So it is in ſpiritual building there was a <hi>Judas,</hi> a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, Matth.</hi> 7.22.23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. For the efficacy of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances does not depend upon Inſtrument; but upon the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and Bleſſing of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Materials of the Ark; <hi>Noah</hi> takes many trees out of the Woods, cuts them down, compacts them, joyneth them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and they muſt be bowed and fitted and joynted: So Chriſt in building his Church; they muſt be cut off the old tree where they grew before, and fitted, and hewed, and humbled, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.5. <hi>I have hewed them by the Prophets:</hi> and then compacted and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together in the Faith, Love and Order of the Goſpel; and ſo they become a Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There was a Door in the Ark, and but one Door, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.16. So in the Church Chriſt is the Door, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.7, 9. by whom alone we enter in to the Father, and find Paſture, that is, full ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies according to our wants.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Ark had a Window to let in Light, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.16. which reſembles the Windows of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6.4. which were made narrow without, and wide within, to diffuſe the Light the better.</p>
               <p>This Light is Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>he is the Light of the World, Luk.</hi> 11.34, 35, 36, as a Candle in a Room enlightens the whole Room: So if there be a Light in the ſupream Faculties of the Soul, that is, true ſpiritual Wiſdom in the heart, it will enlighten the whole man, ſo as to direct and guide it; the whole body of a mans carriage and converſation will be full of Light: the Light he gives diffuſeth it ſelf through the whole man, and has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into all his converſation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There were many Rooms or Chambers in the Ark; and ſo in the Temple; yet all theſe made up but one Ark: this ſignifies many particular Churches; yet all the Churches in the world make up but one Church Catholick, which is the myſtical body of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. as the Body is one, and hath many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and all the Members of that one Body, being many, are one Body: ſo alſo is Chriſt; ſee <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.9. <hi>My undefiled is but one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:96313:52"/>7. There were three Stories in the Ark; it was three Stories high. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.16. and ſo <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple had three parts, an outer Court, an inner Court, and an Holy of Holies. This holds forth the three degrees of the Church. There is,
<list>
                     <item>1. The viſible Church.</item>
                     <item>2. The myſtical Church militant here on Earth.</item>
                     <item>3. The Church triumphant in Heaven.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Church in her loweſt Story is her viſible Members here on Earth, among whom there be many Hypocrites; yet even ſo, <hi>ſhe is more excellent than the Mountains of Prey,</hi> Pſal. 76.4. Kingdoms are called Mountains of prey, that ſaying being too often true, that <hi>magna Regna</hi> are indeed <hi>magna Latrocinia:</hi> But the Church is more glorious than they.</p>
               <p>The inviſible Church is the ſecond Story, <hi>againſt whom all the Gates and Powers of Hell ſhall not prevail,</hi> Matth. 16.18. It is true in ſome ſenſe in general concerning the viſible Church; Chriſt will always have ſome viſible Societies of Chriſtians in the world, that ſhall make profeſſion of his Name; but it holds chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the myſtical Body of Chriſt: True Believers cannot fall away.</p>
               <p>The third Story is the Church triumphant, which is higher than all theſe, and more excellent than all the Kingdoms in the world, than all the Churches upon earth.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They in the Ark were ſafe, and there was no ſafety but in the Ark: ſo in the Church there is Salvation; but no Salvation out of the Church: <hi>Salvation is of the Jews,</hi> Joh. 4. <hi>extra Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam nou eſt Salus.</hi> It is always true of the myſtical Church; and it is ordinarily true concerning the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>Yea the Ark was ſafeſt when the Waters were higheſt. Sea-man have an expreſſion; in a Storm they uſe to wiſh for Sea-room e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: Or we may apply it higher to Chriſt himſelf, and to his myſtical Body; Without Chriſt there is no Salvation; but as they were ſafe in the Ark: So whoſoever is in Chriſt, and a Member of that inviſible Society, he is ſafe, and ſhall never periſh.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In the Ark there were both clean and unclean Beaſts; yet the Ravenouſneſs of their Natures was reſtrained for the time,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96313:53"/>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.2. So in the Church there are both Saints and Hypocrites: Hypocrites are unclean Beaſts</p>
               <p>A <hi>Cham</hi> in the Ark; a <hi>Judas,</hi> a Devil in Chriſts own Family. In the viſible Church there be ſometimes Wolves within, and Sheep without; though they are Wolves in Sheeps clothing. For profane perſons may, and ſhould be kept out, but cloſe Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites cannot.</p>
               <p>For as in the Ark though there were ravenous Beaſts; yet their Natures were reſtrained: ſo in the Church, ſuch as are Beaſts by nature; yet the Corruption of their Natures is reſtrained, there is reſtraining Grace upon Hypocrites in the Church, as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing Grace in the Saints, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.6-9. <hi>They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy Mountain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. There iſſued out of the Ark a Raven and a Dove, whereof the Dove returned again, but the Raven did not, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.7, 8, 9. the Raven is an unclean Bird, <hi>Levit.</hi> 11.15. a Bird of prey, and a Bird of darkneſs, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 34.11.</p>
               <p>The Dove is a Bird of Light: at the Baptiſm of Chriſt, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt deſcended on him in the ſhape of a Dove, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. If a Dove go out from Chriſt and his Ordinances, it ſhall find no reſt, till it returns again into the Ark, and be taken in by the Hand of <hi>Noah,</hi> by the Spirit of Chriſt: But the Raven goes out of the Ark, and returns no more: and how many Ravens are there in the Church that depart and fall off, and return no more? 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. <hi>they went out from us, becauſe they were not of us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You Ravens that are going and coming, and hovering to and fro;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> the old <hi>Geneva</hi> Note.</note> as the Raven, ſhe went and came, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.7. and might light on the outſide of the Ark—</p>
               <p>If you do not get into the Ark, into Chriſt, it ſhews what you are.</p>
               <p>You that are Doves, and gone out, return again, <hi>return to your Reſt, fly as Doves to the Windows, Iſai.</hi> 60.9.</p>
               <p>The Dove is no ravenous Bird, ſhe cannot fight as the Raven, and ſhe is ſwift of Wing; <hi>pray for the Wings of a Dove</hi>— in this ſenſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.6. make haſte to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee what a full and plentiful Analogy there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96313:53"/>
the Ark and the Church in all theſe ten particulars.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Deluge was a Shadow of the Day of Judgment, and the everlaſting Salvation of ſome, and Deſtruction of others at that day. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> parallels them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6, 7. <hi>the World that then was being overflowed with Water periſhed: But the Heavens and the Earth which are now, are reſerved for Fire againſt the day of Judgment.</hi> It was indeed a leſſer day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>magnum futuri Judicii praejudicium.</hi> Hence Hell is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the place of the Gyants, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.16. <hi>The man that wandreth out of the way of underſtanding ſhall remain</hi>

                  <hi>in caetu Gigantum, in the Congregation of the Gyants,</hi> Prov. 9.17, 18. <hi>but he knoweth not that the Gyants are there, and that her Gueſts are in the depths of Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The World will be in a like frame drowned again in deep ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.37, 38, 39. though they ſee all the tokens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, and all things fulfilled that have been foretold; yet they will not be awakened: But when they ſaw the Flood came indeed, Oh the amazement that began to ſeize upon them! when they ſaw the Cataracts of Heaven opened from above, and the Fountains of the great Deep broke up from beneath!</p>
               <p>So at the Day of Judgment <hi>every eye ſhall mourn,</hi> Rev. 1.7. ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. Noah <hi>prepared an Ark to the ſaving of his Houſe, by which he condemned the World:</hi> ſome ſaved by <hi>Noah,</hi> others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Waters that bore up the Ark are made by the Apoſtle a ſhadow of the Water of Baptiſm, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.</p>
               <p>As that Water bore up the Ark, and ſaved them from drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſo doth Baptiſm ſave us.</p>
               <p>For though the Flood was a true and real Hiſtory; ye there be typical Hiſtories; as you will hear further when we come to the <hi>real Types:</hi> Therefore that Water had a typical reſpect to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Noahs</hi> Sacrifice when he came out of the Ark, was a manifeſt Type of the Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt. For ſo indeed were all their Sacrifices, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.20, 21, 22.</p>
               <p>Hence Chriſt is called <hi>a Sacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour,</hi> Eph. 5.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:96313:54"/>God was ſo pleaſed with <hi>Noahs</hi> Sacrifice, that he promiſed to deſtroy the world by Water no more:</p>
               <p>So God is well pleaſed with Chriſts Sacrifice; he is ſo pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, that he will be gratious unto ſinners for the ſake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſo as not to deſtroy them, but ſave their Souls.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Noahs</hi> Covenant, and the Rainbow the ſign thereof, was a Type of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.12, 13.</p>
               <p>It is a queſtion whether there was any Rainbow before, it may ſeem not. Becauſe it had been ſmall comfort and aſſurance to the new World, to ſee that which they had ſeen before, and to have ſuch a ſign of the Covenant.

               <p>So when the Church hath been in Floods of great Waters, Chriſt appears with a Rainbow, <hi>Revel.</hi> 10.1.</p>
               <p>And as he promiſed there ſhall be no more a Flood to deſtroy the Earth: ſo there is a time coming, when there ſhall be no more floods of Perſecution to overwhelm his Church: <hi>I have ſworn I will not be angry with thee, nor rebuke thee any more,</hi> Iſai. 54.9.</p>
               <p>So for particular Souls that have been overflown with the Wrath of God, and the Waters have gone over their Soul, there is a time coming when Chriſt will appear with a Rainbow about his Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:96313:54"/>To ſome he gives ſuch an inward Seal and Teſtimony of their Adoption, that they never looſe it, but carry it in their boſoms to their dying day, keep their Aſſurance all their days. And though I know it is otherwiſe with ſome of his Children; yet at laſt, when they dye and come to Heaven, he will never overflow the ſoul any more with his Anger.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth <hi>perſonal Type</hi> we named was <hi>Melchizedek;</hi> his Story is in <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>That he was <hi>a Type of Chriſt</hi> is clear from <hi>Pſal</hi> 110.4. where ſpeaking of, and to, the Meſſiah, he ſaith, <hi>The Lord hath ſworn, thou art a Prieſt for ever after the Order of</hi> Melchizedek: as alſo from that which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.3. <hi>that he was made like unto the Son of God, and abideth a Prieſt continually. Aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> or <hi>gerens ſimilitudinem.</hi> Some Controverſie there is, who this <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was, and different Opinions there are. The Papiſts have very roving conjectures about it.</p>
               <p>He was not Chriſt himſelf, becauſe he is ſaid to be <hi>made like unto the Son of God,</hi> Heb. 7.3. but no man is ſaid to be like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For ſimilitude is between two.</p>
               <p>That he was not an Angel, or an appearance of God, but a true and real Man, may be proved by this Argument; <hi>becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Prieſt is taken from amongst men,</hi> Heb. 5.1. but <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>And the Scripture ſpeaks of him as a Man: For it mentions the place where he dwelt, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Salem;</hi> which muſt needs be underſtood hiſtorically; becauſe there is no reaſon to conſtrain us to run a to metaphorical ſenſe.</p>
               <p>And whereas ſome object, there was no man then ſuperior to <hi>Abraham</hi> in Faith and Holineſs: But <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was greater than <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some anſwer it thus; <hi>Non ſanctitate, ſed dignitate praefertur A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahae.</hi> For that <hi>Abraham</hi> was but an inferior perſon, whereas <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was King and Prieſt in <hi>Salem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we may anſwer further. That there might, be ſome more eminent than <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſome of his godly Anceſtors, who were aged and experienced Saints: as <hi>Sem</hi> for inſtance, might towards
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96313:55"/>
the end of their lives be more eminent than <hi>Abraham</hi> was in his youth; of whom it is certain by the Genealogies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. that he was yet living: and he was the greateſt perſon then in the world; yea greater than <hi>Abraham,</hi> as being one of his Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>Therefore many do conjecture that <hi>Sem</hi> was this <hi>Melchizedek:</hi> and indeed the conjecture is not improbable; though for any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain demonſtration it is not to be expected, becauſe the Lord hath purpoſely concealed who he was, to the end, he might be a more illuſtrious Type of Chriſt, appearing as it were like a Man fallen down from Heaven, and deſtinated to that end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Wherein was <hi>Melchizedek</hi> a Type of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In regard of the Eternity and Excellency of his Perſon and Office, both as King and Prieſt. There be four particulars here included. He was a Type,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of his Kingdom He is called <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> which the Apoſtle interprets <hi>King of Righteouſneſs, Heb.</hi> 7.2.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt is King of his Church, and <hi>King of Righteouſneſs, Pſal.</hi> 45.6, 7. <hi>King of Salem,</hi> which ſignifies Peace. It is thought to be the ſame City which was afterward called <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> ſo Chriſt was <hi>King of Jeruſalem, Zach.</hi> 9.9. and <hi>King of Peace, Iſai.</hi> 9.6. <hi>My Peace I leave with you, Joh.</hi> 14.27. <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.5. <hi>This Man ſhall be our Peace— Peace that paſſeth all underſtanding</hi>— and Righteouſneſs firſt, then Peace; <hi>Iſai.</hi> 32.17. <hi>the Fruit of Righteouſneſs ſhall be Peace.</hi> Otherwiſe, thou ſhalt have no Peace from Chriſt; unleſs he give thee Righteouſneſs firſt; both imputing his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for Juſtification to thee; and infuſing the inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Sanctification into thee; He will not create Peace for thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of his Prieſthood. <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was Prieſt of the moſt high God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.1. ſo is Chriſt both King and Prieſt. This was extraordinary in <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> that he might be the more glorious Type; God did not ordinarily allow it: the Houſe of <hi>Aaron</hi> had not the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> had not the Prieſthood, they might not intermeddle in the Prieſts Office; King <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> was ſmitten for it: but <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was both.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:96313:55"/>3. In that ſhadow of Eternity which the Story in <hi>Geneſis</hi> doth caſt upon him. He is there brought in as a greater perſon than <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithful: but neither his Birth nor Death mentioned, neither his Father nor Mother, <hi>without either beginning or end of days,</hi> Heb. 7.3. It is not meant, that he was ſo really, but only in ſacred Hiſtory, and in a Type or Shadow: For it is impoſſible for any Creature to be without beginning, that is an eſſential property of God; <hi>Novitas eſſendi eſt de Eſſentia Creaturae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was a Creature, and not God, was prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before; becauſe he was Prieſt and King of <hi>Salem;</hi> and <hi>every Prieſt is taken from amongst men, de Ratione Sacerdotis eſt ut ſit ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Homo,</hi> it is an eſſential requiſite in a Prieſt, that he be indeed a Man: <hi>Melchizedek</hi> therefore was a Man; but yet eternal typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and in a figure.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is called a <hi>Prieſt for ever, Pſal.</hi> 110.4. and of <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>he abideth a Prieſt continually, Heb.</hi> 7.3. You ſhall never have cauſe to ſay, My Friend, alas my beſt Friend is dead: For he hath an everlaſting Prieſthood, and lives for ever to intercede and make mention of you to the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In regard of his Preheminence and Excellency above all other men.<note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Behold how great this man was,</hi> Heb. 7.4. he was greater than <hi>Aaron</hi> the Prieſt of the Lord; yea greater than <hi>Abraham</hi> the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father of <hi>Aaron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was greater than <hi>Abraham,</hi> as in other reſpects: ſo in theſe three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that he bleſſed <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.7. <hi>and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction the leſs is bleſſed of the greater:</hi> ſo Chriſt bleſſeth us, <hi>Luke</hi> 24, 50, 51. All our Bleſſings are through him; he is the Fountain of Bleſſing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that <hi>Melchizedek</hi> did refreſh <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Army, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18. and <hi>Melchizedek</hi> King of <hi>Salem</hi> brought forth Bread and Wine, that is, (as the old Note well explains it) for <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Souldiers Refreſhment, and not to offer Sacrifice: So Chriſt refreſheth his Church with the Word and Sacraments, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96313:56"/>
                  <hi>I will give you reſt,</hi> or I will refreſh you, <hi>Ego reficiam vos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In that <hi>Melchizedek</hi> did receive an homage and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of Tythes from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and from <hi>Levi</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in his Loins. Thus they paid their Reſpects to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.9. whether of his Spoils, or of his Goods, it was the tenth part. Some have gone ſo far from this, as to infer, that we ought to give unto Chriſt the Tenth part of our Goods, as well as the Seventh part of our Time.</p>
               <p>But to let that paſs: Certain it is, that we ought to give ſome fit proportion of our Eſtates unto God, for his uſe and ſervice. And as he was herein greater than <hi>Abraham:</hi> ſo likewiſe greater than <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the Aaronical Order. <hi>Melchizedeks</hi> was an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Order in many reſpects, largely opened in that 7th. to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>

                     <hi>Aug:</hi> 15. 1667.</note>Of the individual Perſonal Types that were before the Law, there be four yet remaining to be ſpoken to.</p>
               <p>You have heard of <hi>Adam, Enoch, Noah, Melchizedek,</hi> how they were Types and Figures of him that was to come.</p>
               <p>It remains, to ſpeak of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Abraham;</hi> As the Apoſtle ſaith of <hi>Melchizedek</hi> in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.4. ſo we may ſay of <hi>Abraham; Conſider how great this
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96313:56"/>
Man was,</hi> in that ſo many Patriarchs, ſo many righteous men, ſo many Prophets, Prieſts and Kings, yea Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, were once in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Loyns.</p>
               <p>I confeſs he is omitted by divers that have handled this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, for what reaſon I know not, unleſs it be from an aptneſs to reſtrain all the Types to the Perſon of Chriſt, wherein perhaps they found the accommodation not ſo clear in reſpect of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> in whom nevertheleſs you will ſee ſome clearneſs, I hope, by and by, even as to that; though it is not always neceſſary in a Type, that it point directly at the Meſſiahs Perſon; but it is ſufficient if there be an adumbration or ſhadowing a forth of any Goſpel Truth or Myſtery any way belonging to him.</p>
               <p>But there were many of them ſhadowed forth in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Scripture owns him for a <hi>typical Perſon,</hi> as you will ſee in the particulars. I ſhall but inſtance in five or ſix things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we conſider him together with <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from him, we may obſerve that in theſe three perſons, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> there is a weak and dark ſhadow of a very great Myſtery, even of thoſe three glorious Perſons, God the Father, Son and Spirit, in the order of their Subſiſtence and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to our Salvation. For <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Father and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of both the other; and in his Love to God he ſpared not his only Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but offered him up to Death for a Burnt-offering: ſo God, in his Love to Man, <hi>ſpared not his only begotten Son, but delivered him up for us,</hi> Rom. 8.32.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> was ſacrificed in a Figure:<note place="margin">Vide <hi>my Expoſ. on</hi> Gen. 22.</note> ſo was the Son of God, the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, in our Nature ſlain and ſacrificed for us.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Jacob,</hi> you know, came both of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and he is renowned for the Spirit of Prayer, <hi>by which he had power with God and prevailed,</hi> Gen. 32.28. He did not prevail by his own ſtrength, but by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, who did appear in him, and acted him as a Spirit of Prayer and Supplication un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch invincible wreſtlings with the Lord.</p>
               <p>From all which you ſee, that there is ſome glimpſe and ſhadow of the Fathers Love, of the Sons Death and Sufferings, and of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96313:57"/>
the Spirit his breathings and workings in us. Here is ſomething of a low and weak repreſentation of that glorious Myſtery of the Trinity, and the influences thereof to our eternal peace; though it is but a low and weak and dark ſhadow of it, as all <hi>Types</hi> are in compariſon of the <hi>Antitype.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If we conſider <hi>Abraham</hi> with his two Wives <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> and their Poſterities <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the two Covenants of Works and Grace, legal and evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Profeſſors are ſhadowed forth.</p>
               <p>For this we have the Apoſtles Authority, and the Teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, the beſt Interpreter of his own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Differences and Properties of the two Covenants are here held forth. <hi>Hagar</hi> by the ſtrength of Nature hath a Child; but <hi>Sarah</hi> by the Faith in the Promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.23. So Works and Fruits brought forth in a mans own ſtrength, theſe are legal: if by Faith in Chriſt, this is evangelical.</p>
               <p>The firſt Covenant-Spirit is a Spirit of bondage, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24, 25. bondage unto ſin and death: the ſecond Covenant-Spirit is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of liberty and freedom; not liberty to ſin, but liberty of ſpirit in and unto Duty.</p>
               <p>The firſt Covenant-Spirit is a Spirit of Perſecution, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. the ſecond Covenant-Spirit is a Spirit of Love.</p>
               <p>Let thoſe Profeſſors look to it, and take heed to their Spirits, who have a rigid, a violent, an impoſing ſpirit towards the people of God, the Children of the Promiſe; take heed leaſt you prove Hagarites, and meer legal Profeſſors.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is true, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did turn aſide unto <hi>Hagar:</hi> ſo a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever that is in the Covenant of Grace may poſſibly turn aſide in ſome particular actings to a Covenant of Works; when through unbelief and neglect of the Promiſe they act according to the Law, in their own ſtrength, or in a way of violence, not of love to their Brethren.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the Bondwoman and her Seed muſt be caſt out, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.30. Away with the Law of Works; we muſt renounce the old Covenant, and get free from the ſnares of ſuch a Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:96313:57"/>3. If we conſider <hi>Abraham</hi> as the Head of the Covenant to that Church and People: ſo he is a Type of Chriſt the Head of the ſecond Covenant.</p>
               <p>You know God covenanted with <hi>Abraham</hi> for his Seed: ſo he doth with Chriſt for all his Elect.</p>
               <p>Gods Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> was to give a Seed to him, and an Inheritance to his Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of Promiſe: ſo God did promiſe to Jeſus Chriſt, that <hi>he ſhould ſee his Seed,</hi> Iſai. 53.10, 11. and to <hi>bring them to Heaven,</hi> Heb. 2.10— Jeſus Chriſt is the true Head of the ſecond Covenant, he engageth and undertakes for all his Seed: <hi>Abraham</hi> was but a typical Head thereof.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Type of Chriſt in regard of his abſolute Obedience to the Will of God; coming from his own Land, and from his Fathers Houſe, ſubmitting to that painful, and, unto car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reaſon, ſhameful and contemptible Ordinance of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; diſmiſſing <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> a thing grievous to a tender-hearted Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; yea, which was yet: more, ſacrificing and offering up his <hi>Iſaac,</hi> his only Son <hi>Iſaac:</hi> there was nothing ſo difficult, but if God require it, <hi>Abraham</hi> will do it; there is not ſuch another Example, there is not an higher inſtance of Obedience in all the Scripture, than in <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſave only in Jeſus Chriſt, who was obedient to his Fathers Will in all things, even unto Death it ſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.38— 8.29— 10.18.</p>
               <p>As God tryed <hi>Abraham</hi> in his <hi>Iſaac:</hi> ſo will he try every Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> in what is deareſt to him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Abrahams</hi> Interceſſion for the Righteous in <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the efficacy of it with the Lord, is ſome ſhadow and reſemblance of the Prayers and Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, and the prevailing efficacy thereof for the Salvation of the Elect, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25. For as <hi>Lot</hi> was ſaved by means of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Prayer from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Sodom:</hi> ſo are we for Chriſts ſake from everlaſting Damnation. For <hi>Sodom</hi> was a Type of Hell, which is therefore called <hi>a Lake of Fire and Brimſtone,</hi> Rev. 21.8.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That he, who was the Father of the Faithful, ſhould be ſo great a Souldier, and Conqueror of five Kings (and indeed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96313:58"/>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> is the firſt godly Warrior we read of in Scripture): It was a good Omen, and a Preſage, what Believers, the Sons of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> ſhould do; and eſpecially in the latter days, when <hi>the Kingdom of Chriſt ſhall prevail,</hi> as <hi>Dan,</hi> 2. and chap. 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Iſaac;</hi> the Scripture takes notice of him as a Type of Chriſt, when it calls both him and Chriſt the promiſed Seed, and ſaith he roſe from the dead, and ſo he dyed alſo in a Figure, or as a Type. He was therefore a Type of Chriſt in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In his Birth.</item>
                  <item>2. In his Death and Sufferings.</item>
                  <item>3. In his Reſurrection from the dead.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of his Birth, which was extraordinary and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, not by the power of Nature, but by virtue of the Promiſe of God. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was the Seed of the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham, Gal.</hi> 4.28. <hi>in whom all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed:</hi> But Chriſt was indeed the promiſed Seed, he was chiefly and principally intended in that Promiſe, ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. in whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone we are truly bleſſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born by virtue of the Promiſe believed on, againſt and above the ordinary courſe of Nature, of <hi>Sarahs</hi> dead Womb, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt was born of the Womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous unconceivable manner, not according to the ordinary courſe of Nature; but by <hi>the power of the Holy Ghoſt overſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her,</hi> Luk. 1.35.</p>
               <p>An Angel did reveal the Birth of <hi>Iſaac</hi> to <hi>Sarah,</hi> and ſhe thought in her ſelf it was impoſſible, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.11, 12. Sarah <hi>heard it, and it had ceaſed to be with</hi> Sarah <hi>after the manner of Women, and</hi> Sarah <hi>laughed within her ſelf, ſaying, after I am waxed old, ſhall I have pleaſure, my Lord being old alſo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So did an Angel reveal to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that Chriſt ſhould be born of her, and ſhe admires and ſaith, <hi>how can this be, ſeeing I have not known Man?</hi> Luk. 1.34.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Birth was promiſed and waited for many years; from the firſt Promiſe of a Seed made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to the Birth of <hi>Iſaac</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:96313:58"/>
was five and twenty years: For he was ſeventy five years old when he left <hi>Haran, Gen.</hi> 12.4. and he was an hundred years old when <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.5.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt the promiſed Seed was long expected and waited for; from the firſt Promiſe of Chriſt in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.<note place="margin">Vid. Ainſworth in loc.</note> to his coming in the Fleſh was well nigh four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was an eminent Type of Chriſt in regard of his Death and Sufferings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> without reſiſtance, without repining or reply, willingly yields himſelf to his Father even unto Death: So was Chriſt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his Father even unto Death. So each of them was led away like a Lamb to the ſlaughter, as is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.7. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.32.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> carried the Wood whereon he was bound to <hi>Moriah, Gen.</hi> 22.6. ſo did Chriſt carry the Croſs whereon he was nailed to <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotha, Joh.</hi> 19.17. and ſo the Wood was firſt laid upon them both, and then they were laid upon the Wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> was to be offered alone, the Servants being left behind at the foot of the Hill, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.5. So Chriſt muſt tread the Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs alone, his Diſciples being fled and ſcattered from him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.32.</p>
               <p>The place where <hi>Iſaac</hi> was offered was Mount <hi>Moriah, Gen.</hi> 22.2. and there was the Temple built, a Type of Chriſts Body: and there alſo his Body was crucified, upon another part of the ſame Mountain.</p>
               <p>And as to the time, ſomething of analogy may be noted: ſome accommodated it thus, that as <hi>Iſaac</hi> came the third day to the place of his Immolation: ſo Chriſt came to his Sufferings the thirty third year of his age, conſiſting of three tens and three units. And it was three years after his Entrance upon his publick Miniſtry, which is three days, putting a day for a year according to the Prophetick ſtile, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.23. he began his Miniſtry the thirtieth year of his age.</p>
               <p>And there be four Paſſovers mentioned in the Goſpel of <hi>John,</hi> in the ſacred Story of his Life and Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:96313:59"/>Or we may apply this circumſtance more literally in reference to his Reſurrection from the dead, which is the</p>
               <p n="3">3. Third thing wherein <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a Type of Chriſt, thus; that they were both delivered from Death the third day.</p>
               <p>Look, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was reputed among the dead in his Fathers thoughts and purpoſe for three days, who had given him up unto the Lord; but he received him again as from the dead after three days.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt was in the ſtate of Death three days; but then roſe again to dye no more; ſo that as <hi>Iſaac</hi> in three days was both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live and dead, and revived in a figure, Chriſt was ſo in truth. In this reſpect the Apoſtle clearly makes him a Type of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.19. accounting that God was able to raiſe him up even from the dead, from whence alſo he received him in a Figure. For <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Death and Reſurrection was not a real Death and Reſurrection; but a figurative Death, and a figurative Reſurrection: The truth of which Figure is in Chriſt, who both dyed and roſe again real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and indeed. <hi>I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore,</hi> Amen, <hi>and have the Keys of Hell and of Death, Revel.</hi> 1.18.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Jacob;</hi> he alſo was a Type of Chriſt, and is intimated in the Scripture ſo to be, in that Chriſt is called by his Name, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.3. <hi>Thou art my Servant, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>in whom I will be glorified;</hi> they are the words of God the Father unto Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> was a Type of Chriſt,

               <p n="1">1. In his ſojourning and travelling to and fro in an afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition almoſt all his days: For he ſeems to have been the moſt afflicted Saint that we read of in Scripture, except <hi>Job;</hi> He leaves his Fathers Houſe and goes to <hi>Haran,</hi> and lives there as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant for his two Wives, <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah, Gen.</hi> 28.10. and 29.18, 27.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt left the Boſom of his Father, deſcended from the higheſt Heavens, and ſojourned here upon earth in the form of a Servant, to purchaſe to himſelf a Spouſe, a Church of Jews and Gentiles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:96313:59"/>
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> alſo went down into <hi>Egypt</hi> by Gods direction, and there <hi>Joſeph</hi> fed him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.3.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt was carried into <hi>Egypt</hi> by <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Son of another <hi>Jacob,</hi> being warned ſo to do by the Lord in a Dream: and was there fed and provided for by <hi>Joſeph</hi> his reputed Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.13.</p>
               <p>And as the Lord brought <hi>Jacob</hi> back again in his Poſterity, who carried his Bones with them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.4. <hi>I will ſurely bring thee up again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So he brought Chriſt out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in his own perſon.</p>
               <p>And that this Hiſtory had a typical reſpect to Chriſt, you may ſee in <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.1. <hi>when</hi> Iſrael <hi>was a Child, then I loved him, and called my Son out of</hi> Egypt. It is ſpoken there hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically; but not only ſo, but prophetically alſo: For that Hiſtory of <hi>Iſraels</hi> going into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and returning again, was a typical Hiſtory, and did repreſent what was to be done in Chriſt the true <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Jacob</hi> was alſo a Type of Chriſt in regard of his wreſtling and prevailing with the Lord; When he was to meet <hi>Eſau,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to Prayer that night and prevailed, from whence he got the name of <hi>Iſrael, Gen.</hi> 32.28. <hi>and he ſaid, thy Name ſhall be called no more</hi> Jacob, <hi>but</hi> Iſrael: <hi>For as a Prince thou haſt power with God and with men, and haſt prevailed:</hi> Hoſ. 12.4. Yea <hi>he wept and made ſupplication unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Chriſt often, and particularly the night before his Sufferings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>who in the days of his Fleſh, when he had offered up Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Supplications with ſtrong crying and tears unto him that was able to ſave him from Death; and was heard in that he feared;</hi> for he had that which was equivalent.</p>
               <p>You know his Agonies in Prayer that night, when he ſaid, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me; nevertheleſs not my Will, but thy Will be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea <hi>he lives for ever to intercede,</hi> Heb. 7.25.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth and laſt <hi>perſonal Type</hi> that is now to be ſpoken to, is <hi>Joſeph.</hi> The Hiſtory of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in the latter end of <hi>Geneſis</hi> is a very admirable and an affecting Hiſtory. In Poems and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96313:60"/>
to pleaſe and affect the Mind, men take liberty to feign; yet they come far ſhort of this which was a real Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>It is true <hi>Joſeph</hi> is not ſo expreſly mentioned in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament as a Type of Chriſt, as <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> are; but the analogy is ſo clear and full, that we cannot well omit him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſeph multis modis Figuram Chriſti geſtavit, vel potius viva fuit ejus Imago,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin in Matth.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Analogy is marvellous clear in ſundry particulars; I ſhall but inſtance in four things, wherein he was (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of another eminent Type) <hi>made like unto the Son of God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Joſeph</hi> may be fitly numbred amongſt the Types of Chriſt; for he was very eminent both as to Wiſdom and Holineſs.</p>
               <p>As for Wiſdom, he had a Prophetical Light ſhining in him, from whence <hi>Pharaoh</hi> gave him that honourable name <hi>Zaphnath payaneah,</hi> a clear Revealer of Secrets, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.45. the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Language, though not the ſame with the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> yet had ſome affinity with it. The firſt word <hi>Tſopnath Secretum</hi> comes from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>duxit placide, Joſeph</hi> was eminent for leading by the hand into ſecret hidden myſteries.</p>
               <p>It was ſaid of him by <hi>Pharaoh, Can we find ſuch a man as this is, in whom the Spirit of God is?</hi> Gen. 41.38. <hi>and foraſmuch as God hath ſhewed thee all this, there is none ſo diſcreet and wiſe as thou art.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So in Chriſt are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge,</hi> Col. 2.3. <hi>He received the Spirit without meaſure,</hi> Joh. 3.34. <hi>He is the wonderful Counſellor,</hi> Iſai. 9.6. <hi>the wonderful Numberer,</hi> Dan. 8.13. <hi>the true Palmoni,</hi> or numberer of Secrets.</p>
               <p>And as for Holineſs, <hi>Joſeph</hi> was tempted by his Miſtreſs to bodily Adultery, but he reſiſted and overcame the temptation: So Chriſt was tempted to Idolatry (which is ſpiritual Adultery,)
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96313:60"/>
but overcame the Tempter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. And Believers alſo are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious through him. <hi>Thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.57.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of his Sufferings, both from his Brethren, and from Strangers alſo, his Miſtreſs and other Egyptians. His Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were very grievous, <hi>the Archers ſorely grieved him, and ſhot at him, and hated him,</hi> Gen. 49.3. It is ſaid, <hi>the Irons entred into his Soul,</hi> Pſal. 105.17, 18.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt did ſuffer grievous things from the Jews, his own Brethren and Countrymen, and from the <hi>Romans,</hi> thoſe ſpiritual <hi>Egyptians. He came to his own, but his own received him not,</hi> Joh. 1.11.<note place="margin">See <hi>Calvin</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> cap. 2. ver. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </note> but they delivered him up to the <hi>Romans:</hi> He was a <hi>Nazarite</hi> as it were, <hi>ſeparate from his Brethren,</hi> Gen. 49.26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.16. And what moved them to this? It was, for that of God that was in him. <hi>The Patriarchs, moved with envy, ſold</hi> Joſeph <hi>into</hi> Egypt, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.9.</p>
               <p>So it is ſaid of Chriſt, that <hi>Pilate</hi> knew that for envy they had delivered him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.18.</p>
               <p>They hated him eſpecially for that he by divine Viſions and Revelations told them, that he ſhould be exalted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.8.</p>
               <p>So the Jews ſought the more to kill the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he not only had broken the Sabbath, as they thought, but ſaid alſo that God was his Father, making himſelf equal with God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.18— <hi>If we let him alone, you'l ſee all men go after him,</hi> Joh. 11.48.</p>
               <p>And when did they do this injury to <hi>Joſeph?</hi> It was when he was ſhewing kindneſs, and doing good to them: For his Father had ſent him to ſeek and viſit his Brethren in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.13, 14. <hi>Then they conſpire againſt him, and call him Dreamer,</hi> ſell him for twenty pieces of Silver to the Iſhmaelites, and they to the Egyptians, where he is falſly accuſed, condemned and put in Priſon.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt is ſent from Heaven by his Father into the Wilderneſs of this world, to viſit his Brethren the Sons of Men; but <hi>Judas</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> conſpire againſt him, call him a Seducer; he is ſold for 30 pieces of Silver by one of his own Diſciples, he is falſly accuſed,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96313:61"/>
condemned, and crucified between two Malefactors, like <hi>Joſeph</hi> impriſoned with <hi>Pharaohs</hi> two Servants.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren, when they were reſolved to kill him, and had thrown him into the pit, they thought they had made ſure work with him, <hi>we will ſee what will become of his Dreams, Gen.</hi> 37.20.</p>
               <p>So the Jews thought of Chriſt, they thought they had him ſure enough when they had him upon the Croſs, and in the Grave.</p>
               <p>But the hand of Providence was in all this, ordering and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling it for good, to another iſſue than the Inſtruments intended or expected, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.5, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>So it is ſaid of <hi>Herod,</hi> and the Gentiles, and the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> that they were gathered together to do whatſoever thy Hand and thy Counſel determined before to be done, <hi>Act</hi> 4.28. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23. <hi>him being delivered by the determinate Counſel and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God, ye have taken &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And you know the end of it was good to his Brethren; for ſo he calls his Elect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11. yea ſaving everlaſting good both unto <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who both had an hand in his Sufferings; as both <hi>Joſephs Brethren</hi> had, and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> too in his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the end and iſſue whereof was the ſaving of the Lives of both of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Come we now to <hi>Joſephs</hi> advancement to all his Glory; here likewiſe was a ſhadow of what was done in Chriſt. For as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was brought firſt into ſuch a low condition, and then to the greateſt height of worldly Glory, from a Priſon to a Kingdom, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.23, 24. So Chriſt was firſt humbled, then exalted.</p>
               <p>Who would have thought that had ſeen <hi>Joſeph</hi> in the Priſon, that ever he ſhould come to be a Prince and a Ruler in the Land?</p>
               <p>And when the Diſciples ſaw Chriſt upon the Croſs, how little did they think to ſee him reign? they were giving up their hopes in him, <hi>we truſted it had been he, which ſhould have redemed</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.21.</p>
               <p>Now was <hi>Joſephs</hi> Dream fulfilled, that all their Sheaves would bow to his; now the Sun, Moon and Stars did obeyſance to him. For he was made next to <hi>Pharaoh, and they cryed before him, bow the knee,</hi> Gen. 41.43.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:96313:61"/>
                  <hi>And in the name of Jeſus every knee ſhall bow:</hi> For <hi>God hath given him a Name above every Name,</hi> Phil. 2.10, 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt be over my Houſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pharaoh, Gen.</hi> 41.40. <hi>and he made him Ruler over all the Land of</hi> Egypt, ver. 43.</p>
               <p>So he hath <hi>put all things</hi> into the hands and <hi>under the feet of Jeſus Chriſt, and hath made him head over all things to the Church, Epheſ,</hi> 1.22. He is an Head of eminence over all; he is an Head of ſaving influence to the Church.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Joſephs Brethren,</hi> as ſtout as they were, yet at laſt came to him for ſupplies, and did obeyſance to him whom they had ſold and ſlighted.</p>
               <p>So muſt Sinners to Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo ſhall <hi>his Brethren the Jews,</hi> though they have ſtood it out long againſt him, yet they ſhall come in at laſt, and humble themſelves before <hi>him whom they have pierced, Zach.</hi> 12.10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Joſeph</hi> bare a ſimilitude of the Son of God in his carriage towards his Brethren, which was moſt heroick and Saint-like, yea Chriſt-like, in requiting good for evil, forgiving all their injuries, and ſhewing kindneſs to them, who had done all the wrong they could to him.</p>
               <p>And doth not Chriſt ſo to us? he prayed for thoſe that cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him, he ſaves us, who have killed him.</p>
               <p>This in general was <hi>Joſephs</hi> deportment and carriage towards his Brethren, and you ſee it was indeed divine and excellent: but let us alſo look into ſome particular paſſages of it which were moſt remarkable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He knew them, when they knew not him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.8.</p>
               <p>So doth Chriſt know us before we know him: yea when we are tempted to think he takes no notice of us. <hi>I ſaw thee when thou waſt under the Fig-tree,</hi> Joh. 1.48.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He carries it roughly towards them a while at firſt, to bring them to Repentance, <hi>Gen,</hi> 42.7-21. and this made them reflect upon their own ſins.</p>
               <p>So doth Chriſt to Souls, he firſt humbles, and then comforts; firſt he wounds and breaks the heart, and then he heals it and binds it up; he frowns upon them at firſt, and pierceth their
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96313:62"/>
hearts through with godly ſorrow, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. and afterwards he pours in the oyl of Joy and Comfort, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61, 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Joſeph</hi> reveals himſelf to them at laſt, in the ſweeteſt melting expreſſions of his Love &amp; Bowels towards them, when they were fit for it, and when his own heart was full, that he could contain no longer. See the Story of it, <hi>Gen</hi> 45.1, 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>So doth Jeſus Chriſt reveal himſelf to the Souls of his people, when they are fit for it; he gives them clear and ſweet diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, raviſhing and amazing manifeſtations of his Love; <hi>I am</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph <hi>your Brother: I am Jeſus thy Saviour,</hi> who was crucified and pierced for thee, as well as by thee, which thou haſt been ſo long mourning for; but I have ſeen thy tears, I have heard thy Prayers, and I am now come to comfort thee, and to tell thee, that I am thine, and thou art mine: ſuch words as theſe they hear, to this effect he ſpeaks, when he cauſeth them to hear the voice of his Loving Kindneſs, and ſheds abroad his Love in their hearts by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſupplies all their wants, makes proviſion for them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way; he gives them their Corn, without taking their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; waſhes them, ſets them at his Table, and feeds them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.16, 33, 34. gives them Victuals and Chariots for their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, with a Charge not to fall out by the way, <hi>chap.</hi> 45.19, 24. And finally placeth them in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> in the beſt of the Land, there to dwell, till they ſhould go to <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of Promiſe, <hi>cap.</hi> 47.11.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt doth all this in an higher way. He gives us all the good we need, and that freely, without Mony, or without price: he waſheth and cleanſeth us inwardly by his Spirit, as well as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by the Water of Baptiſm; feeds us at his Table, not only with bodily, but with ſpiritual Food; gives us his Ordinances as Chariots of Salvation to bring us to himſelf, and Signs and Seals of his Love to us, and of our Love to him, and to one another. It is his great Commandment to his Diſciples, to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and finally he plants us in <hi>Goſhen</hi> here, in a ſtate of Light and Grace, till we come to the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> to a ſtate of Glory. Thus doth our true <hi>Joſeph</hi> provide for us.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:96313:62"/>5. Yet after all this, they had ſome ſecret fears and doubtings of his Love; whereupon they ſeek Pardon of their former Sins; but he gives them renewed aſſurance of it, to quiet their fears, and ſettle their doubting thoughts, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.15, 21. through the remembrance of their own Guilt, and Sins againſt him.</p>
               <p>So poor Souls, when Chriſt hath ſpoken Peace, yet there be oftentimes ſome ſecret fears and doubts remaining, or returning upon them again, after all his appearances; when he appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them again in <hi>Gallilee;</hi> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.17. it is ſaid, <hi>and when they ſaw him, they worſhipped him, but ſome doubted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in ſuch as are the Lords, theſe fears and doubts ſet them upon the renewed exerciſe of Grace, reflecting and ſearching their own hearts and ways, and ſeeking Pardon of former Sins: and in this way, the Lord renews his Love, and gives them new and freſh evidences and further aſſurance of it, and bids them fear not; and ſo quiets their hearts again, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did his Brethrens.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>individual Perſons</hi> that were <hi>Types of Chriſt</hi> have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto two Claſſes.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Such as were <hi>before the Law.</hi>
                  </item>

               </list>
               <p>The <hi>typical Perſons</hi> that were <hi>before the Law</hi> have been ſpoken to. We are now to proceed (as the Lord ſhall enable) unto <hi>typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Perſons under the Law,</hi> and they were many and divers. I ſhall not mention all, but only (as in the former ſort) ſome of the chief and moſt illuſtrious of them.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the nature of the matter will not only bear it; but doth partly lead unto it, none of them giving a full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Repreſentation of the Meſſiah; and there being ſomething of Connexion remarkable in the Hiſtories and Actions of divers of them; I ſhall therefore put them together in pairs, or in ſeveral <hi>Conjunctions</hi> and <hi>Conſtellations,</hi> as it were, whereby they will yield the greater luſtre, and give a more clear and full Repreſentation
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96313:63"/>
of that glorious perſon whom the Lord ordained and deſigned them to repreſent; like the <hi>Galaxia</hi> in the Heavens, which <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers</hi> conceive to be a <hi>Conjunction</hi> or <hi>Conglobation of many leſſer Stars ſhining together,</hi> which gives that luſtre, which we call the <hi>Via lactea,</hi> the milky way in the Heavens. The conjoyning or putting of them thus together will be ſome help both to your Uerſtandings and Memories.</p>
               <p>Now there were <hi>four eminent Conjunctions</hi> or <hi>Conſtellations,</hi> as it were (for I know not well what fitter word to expreſs it by) <hi>of typical Perſons</hi> who ſhone like bright Stars in the night, in thoſe darker times <hi>under the Law,</hi> before the Sun of Righteouſneſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aroſe with Light and Healing in his Wings.</p>
               <p>The firſt is <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſuah,</hi> whereof the one delivered them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the other brought them into <hi>Canaan;</hi> a Shadow both of the evil we are ſaved from, and of the good we are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of, by him who is the true <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſuah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Conſtellation or Conglobation of typical perſons is, <hi>Sampſon, David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> all which three put together, gives a bright and glorious Repreſentation of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Sampſon</hi> in his Death and Sufferings, <hi>David</hi> in his Victories and Conqueſts, <hi>Solomon</hi> in the peace, and quiet eſtabliſhment of his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The third is <hi>Elijah, Eliſha</hi> and <hi>Jonah,</hi> three Prophets; the firſt whereof was an illuſtrious Type of Chriſts Aſcenſion, the ſecond of the Continuance of his Preſence and Spirit in his Apoſtles and Miniſters ever ſince (for the Spirit of <hi>Elijah</hi> did reſt upon <hi>Eliſha,</hi>) and the Death of Chriſt, which was the procuring cauſe both of his Aſcenſion, and the effuſion of his Spirit, is ſhadowed forth in <hi>Jonah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt that I ſhall ſpeak to, is <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhuah;</hi> one whereof was the <hi>Prince,</hi> and the other the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> and both Rebuilders of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and Reſtorers of the collapſed eſtate of the Church of God in thoſe times.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt then for <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> the one (as I ſaid) deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the other brought them into <hi>Canaan;</hi> and ſo ſhadowed forth both our Deliverance from ſpiritual Bondage and Miſery, and the bringing of us into a ſtate of ſpiritual Reſt and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96313:63"/>
Happineſs by Jeſus Chriſt. There was a Prefiguration of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the latter in <hi>Joſhuah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Scripture ſpeaks of him, as the greateſt perſon upon all accounts that ever was in the world, <hi>except Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> See the three laſt verſes of <hi>Deuteronomy; And there aroſe not a Prophet ſince in</hi> Iſrael <hi>like unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>whom the Lord knew face to face: In all the ſigns and wonders which the Lord ſent him to do in the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>to</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>and all his Servants, and to all his Land, and in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which</hi> Moſes <hi>ſhewed in the fight of all</hi> Iſrael.</p>
               <p>As to all humane and divine Excellencies and Accompliſhments, and appearances of God in him, there was never his fellow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melchizedek</hi> indeed was greater in one reſpect, as to that ſhadow of Eternity and unchangeable Glory beforementioned: <hi>Solomon</hi> was greater as to the outward Peace and Splendor of his Kingdom, and as to univerſal Inſight into all the depths, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and myſteries of Nature: But neither of them had ſuch continual viſible Entercourſe and Communion with God in viſible appearances to him upon all occaſions: Neither of them wrought ſuch Miracles, nor were they inſtrumental to ſo great a work of Providence, as the Deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which, with all the paſſages and circumſtances belonging to it, was the greateſt and the higheſt Diſpenſation of Providence that ever was, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of our Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Yea ſo famous was the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that though it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry antient; yet the Heathen Hiſtorians and Poets have ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it. And he is thought by ſome to be their <hi>Mercurius Triſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megiſtus,</hi> of whom they ſpake out of ſome broken remembrances and traditions, though corrupted with fabulous Inventions inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd; wherein yet ſome footſteps of the Truth may be diſcerned. They call their <hi>Mercurius, Interpres Divum,</hi> and paint him with a Rod twined with Serpents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a <hi>Type,</hi> the Scripture is clear, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.18. <hi>I will raiſe them up a Prophet from among their Brethren, like unto thee</hi>— Heb. 3.2. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, who was faithful to him that appointed him, as alſo</hi> Moſes <hi>was faithful in all his Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:96313:64"/>But how, or wherein was <hi>Moſes a Type?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Anſwer is in two reſpects: For <hi>Moſes</hi> may be conſidered two ways.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In regard of his Diſpenſation, and ſo he was a type of the Law.</item>
                  <item>2. In regard of his Perſon, and ſo he was a Type of Jeſus Chriſt: And ſo we have two things to inquire into.
<list>
                        <item>1. What of the Law, and</item>
                        <item>2. What of Jeſus Chriſt was ſhadowed forth in <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>I ſhall begin with the lower Notion firſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Type of the Law in regard of the Diſpenſation wherein the Lord was pleaſed to uſe him, and to introduce by his Miniſtry into the Church. For (as hath been formerly ſhewed) the Types are not always to be reſtrained only to the Perſon of Chriſt; But there were legal ſhadows of all other Truths, which are more clearly and fully revealed under the New Teſtament: And ſo they had their Types and Shadows even of the Covenant of Works, as was ſhewed in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Wives and Children: So likewiſe <hi>Moſes</hi> his Adminiſtration of the Mind of God ſhadowed forth the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>Hence the Scripture ſpeaks ſo much of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of Works. <hi>The Law came by</hi> Moſes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17. that is, as contradiſtinguiſhed unto Goſpel Grace and Truth, for it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: <hi>but Grace and Truth by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Not that <hi>Moſes</hi> his Diſpenſation was indeed a Covenant of Works but a ſhadow or repreſentation of it. For had it been indeed a Covenant of Works, it would have been their Duty to ſeek Salvation by their own Merits: but they were ſaved by Grace as well as we, and not by Works: they were ſaved by Faith in Chriſt, and in his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, whereof they had ſome diſcoveries; they were under a Diſpenſation of Grace: but it was like a Covenant of Works, and did very much reſemble that legal way in many reſpects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But wherein was the <hi>Moſaical Diſpenſation</hi> ſo like unto the Covenant of Works? what of the Law was ſhadowed forth in <hi>Moſes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Something was hinted as to this in the firſt Sermon on <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. But now to ſpeak a little further to it.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:96313:64"/>1. In regard of the dreadful Majeſty, and Terror, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that Adminiſtration. Herein it was like the old Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.18.—21. God acts as a Soveraign Lord in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, and appears in the dreadful Glory of his abſolute Soveraignty and Dominion over his Creatures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was a darkneſs alſo in that Diſpenſation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.18. <hi>Ye are not come unto blackneſs, and darkneſs, and Tempeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Moſes</hi> had a Veil upon his Face, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.29, 30, 33. But there was a further myſtery in this Veil; it ſignifieth a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Veil, a Covering upon the Heart, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13.14. a Veil upon their Minds, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.27. the Prophets, they underſtood them not, though read every Sabbath day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There was a Yoke of Bondage, which neither we nor our Fathers (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) were able to bear, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10. ſo <hi>the Law genders unto Bondage,</hi> Gal. 4.24, 25. Such as are under the Law, their Spirits are under continual Bondage: but the Goſpel is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Liberty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The abiding Strength and Power of the Law to condemn, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3— <hi>the Letter killeth</hi>— It is the Miniſtration of Death: And as <hi>Moſes</hi> his natural Force was not abated, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.7. ſo neither is the Strength of the Law, as to its condemning Power over Sinners.</p>
               <p>Hereby the continual force of the Law is ſignified, the Power whereof decayeth not in the Conſcience of Sinners by number of Days or mutitude of Works,<note place="margin">Anſworth in lec.</note> till God take it away, and aboliſh it by Grace in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Weakneſs of it to ſave. <hi>Moſes</hi> might not enter into <hi>Canaan,</hi> though he did much deſire it; ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.52. And the Reaſon alledged is his failing in that one point, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.12.</p>
               <p>What was <hi>Moſes</hi> his error and miſtake at that time? There is ſomething of difficulty to diſcern, and make it out.</p>
               <p>Three things the Scripture ſeemeth to intimate.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. He ſmote the Rock twice, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.11. when his Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were no more, but to ſpeak unto it, <hi>v.</hi> 8.</item>
                  <item>2. Something of inordinate Paſſion ſeems to be noted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. <hi>he ſpake unadviſedly with his Lips,</hi> v. 33.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:96313:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. His Unbelief is expreſly taxed, <hi>becauſe ye believed not my Word,</hi> Numb. 20.12.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But what was this Unbelief? or how came it to be working in him at this time?</p>
               <p>Some have gueſſed at it thus.</p>
               <p>This Occurrence fell out eight and thirty years after their firſt murmuring for Water: and their was a new Generation now riſen up, and they falling into the very ſame ſin, and that at the ſame place, upon the Borders of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and upon the ſame occaſion, want of Water, for which the Lord had rejected and excluded their Fathers; <hi>Moſes</hi> was afraid that the Lord would now take advantage againſt this Generation alſo, as he did againſt their Anceſtors, cauſing them to wander forty years; and as indeed he might juſtly have done againſt theſe alſo: But yet <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould not have given way to ſuch Fears, unleſs the Lord had declared it, which as to this Generation he did not: But for this one failing <hi>Moſes</hi> could not enter into <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Law, if but one Sin be admitted, keeps the Soul of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: the Law is ſtrong to condemn and deſtroy Sinners, but it is unable and weak to ſave them. The Law cannot ſave, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.</p>
               <p>Yea, 6. The abrogation of it through Grace.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Body was buried that it could not be found, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.6. and Satan would have brought it forth again; but <hi>Michael</hi> oppoſed him, <hi>Jud.</hi> 9. ſo he hath buried the Law; though Satan would revive it in the Spirits of Men.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Moſes</hi> did prepare the people for <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> Diſpenſation: So the Law prepares and ſits the Soul for Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law was our Schoolmaſter, to bring us unto Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by Faith.</hi> It doth not put us into Chriſt, but it prepares us for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus, in regard of the Terror of that Diſpenſation, and the Darkneſs and Bondage of it, the Strength to condemn, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of it to bring them into Reſt, and the Abrogation of it, and that nevertheleſs it did prepare and fit them for it, <hi>Moſes</hi> did adumbrate and ſhadow forth the Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p>But, 2. We may conſider <hi>Moſes</hi> under an higher notion, though
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96313:65"/>
in reſpect of the external Diſpenſation introduced by him, he ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed forth the Law; yet in other reſpects, if we conſider him in his own Perſon, he was a Type of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Scripture is clear for this alſo, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15, 18. <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord thy God raiſe up unto thee of thy Brethren like unto me</hi>— That this was ſpoken of Chriſt, ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Peter</hi> there applies it unto Chriſt, <hi>he was like unto</hi> Moſes.</p>
               <p>There was a Similitude, but yet there was not a Parity. For Chriſt was far above <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 3.3. <hi>For this man was counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of more Glory than</hi> Moſes, <hi>inaſmuch as he who builded the Houſe hath more Glory than the Houſe:</hi> and again <hi>ver.</hi> 5. Moſes <hi>verily was faithful as a Servant; but Chriſt as a Son over his own Houſe,</hi> v. 6. You may ſee it in theſe particulars.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In regard of his Birth.</item>
                  <item>2. In his perſonal Qualifications.</item>
                  <item>3. In the whole courſe of his Life.</item>
                  <item>4. In the cloſe of it.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Type of Chriſt in regard of his Birth, in that he was born but of mean Parents, in the time of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Bondage in <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 2.1. perſecuted in his Infancy by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully preſerved, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.3, 9.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.2. <hi>He ſhall grow up as a Root out of a dry ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> was brought very low, and the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it ſeemingly extinct, they were of the pooreſt ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as appears by their Offering, which was but a pair of Turtle Doves, or two young Pigeons, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.24. when they taxed all the world, that is when the <hi>Jews</hi> were under Bondage to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Luk.</hi> 2.1, 4. and you know <hi>Rome</hi> is ſpiritually called <hi>Egypt;</hi> then, and in this condition of Subjection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Power was Chriſt born: And as ſoon as born, he was perſecuted by <hi>Herod, Matth.</hi> 2. who ſought his Death; but wonderfully preſerved, and by means of his reputed Father, as <hi>Moſes</hi> by the Mother that adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; both of them by wonderful Providences ſaved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, that they might be Saviours and Deliverers unto others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Type of Chriſt in his perſonal Qualifications,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96313:66"/>
which were very eminent. He was the moſt accompliſh'd Perſon that ever was, except Jeſus Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In Learning and Knowledge, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.22. <hi>He was learned in all the Wiſdom of the</hi> Egyptians.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.1, 2, 3. the Spirit of Wiſdom and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the Spirit of Counſel and of Knowledge reſted upon him, to make him of quick Underſtanding in the Fear of the Lord; inſomuch that <hi>he diſputed with the Doctors at twelve years of age, Luke</hi> 2.42, 46, 47. Thoſe <hi>Doctors</hi> were as too many are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days eaten up with mens <hi>Traditions,</hi> and ignorant of the Scripture. The <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledged and admired it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.15. <hi>And the Jews marvelled, ſaying, how knoweth this man Learning, having never learned,; and</hi> ver. 46. <hi>the Officers anſwered, never man ſpake like this man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Clear and extraordinary Viſion and Sight of God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. <hi>Face to Face, Mouth to Mouth</hi> God ſpake to <hi>Moſes,</hi> even ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently, and not in dark ſpeeches; <hi>and the ſimilitude of the Lord did he behold:</hi> expreſſions arguing unparallell'd Clearneſs in the Lords revealing himſelf and his Mind to <hi>Moſes.</hi> There was never the like vouchſafed to any other. To others, even Prophets the Lord made known himſelf in a Viſion, or ſpake to them in Dreams, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. but to <hi>Moſes</hi> at another rate.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. <hi>no man hath ſeen God at any time, but the only begotten Son, which is in the boſom of the Father, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There was in <hi>Moſes</hi> an admirable mixture of Meekneſs and Zeal; eminent in meekneſs of Spirit, and that ſeaſoned and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with holy Zeal, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.3. <hi>forty years he bare their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the Wilderneſs,</hi> Acts 7.36. with 13.18. though murmuring and rebelling againſt God and himſelf, with an invincible Patience.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.</hi> When his Diſciples tempted him, he would not fetch down Fire from Heaven againſt his Deſpiſers and Oppoſers; yet he was angry at the Defilement of the Temple, and whipt them out: And ſo was <hi>Moſes</hi> at the Golden Calf— Meekneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Zeal is nothing elſe but Lukewarmneſs and Cowardiſe. Zeal
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96313:66"/>
without Meekneſs degenerates into ſinful Paſſion. We ſhould be meek in our own Cauſe; but zealous in the Cauſe of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Faithfulneſs to his Truſt; this was eminent in <hi>Moſes,</hi> but more eminent in Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.5, 6. Moſes <hi>was but faithful as a Servant in his Lords Houſe. But Chriſt as a Son in his own Houſe.</hi> He will not loſe one Soul of all thoſe that the Father hath committed to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39, 40. In his laſt Prayer he profeſſeth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.12. <hi>thoſe that thou giveſt me I have kept, and none of them is loſt, but the Son of perdition:</hi> not the leaſt Believer can or ſhall miſcarry.</p>
               <p>If thou ſayſt, How may I know whether I was committed to the truſt and care of Jeſus Chriſt by the Father?</p>
               <p>The Anſwer is, If thou doſt commit thy ſelf to him, the Lord hath done it. Thou couldſt never truſt thy ſelf with him; thou couldſt not commit thy Soul to his keeping, if the Lord had not firſt intruſted thee with him in his eternal Counſel and Covenant of Redemption. But thou haſt done it, and it is thy daily work; therefore thou maiſt ſafely conclude with <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>he will keep the thing I have committed to him:</hi> He will be faithful to God, and faithful to thee; he never failed any that truſted in him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Type of Chriſt in the whole courſe of his Life. And here many things come to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Work and Office.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Sufferings and Conflicts in the Diſcharge thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lords owning and bearing witneſs to him by Miracles and Signs and Wonders; in all which there was a manifeſt Prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In his Work and Office. He was in general a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the People, <hi>a typical Mediator.</hi> All the good that God was pleaſed to confer upon that People, it was by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and Interpoſition between God and then, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>the Law was ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator</hi>— Deut. 5.5. <hi>I ſtood between the Lord and you at that time, to ſhew you the Word of the Lord; for ye were afraid by reaſon of the Fire, and went not up into the Mount,</hi> Exod, 19.7, 8.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt is the Mediator of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96313:67"/>
and for this cauſe he is <hi>the Mediator of the New Teſtament.</hi> But he hath the preheminence above <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 8.6. <hi>but now hath he obtained a more excellent Miniſtry, by how much alſo he is the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of a better Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God was pleaſed to redeem his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage in <hi>Egypt</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> his Miniſtry: God ſent him, and he left his former Employment and Place to do this Work, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Come now therefore and I will ſend thee unto</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>that thou maiſt bring forth my people the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>out of</hi> Egypt.</p>
               <p>But by Jeſus Chriſt he redeemeth us out of the ſpiritual Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Sin and <hi>Satan,</hi> which is worſe than <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage; and he was ſent by his Father, and was content to come down from Heaven, and to leave his Glory to do this great Work; wherein Chriſt hath the preheminence. For <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor only of temporal and typical Redemption: but Chriſt is the Mediator of ſpiritual and eternal Redemption.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Moſes</hi> his Mediation alſo, the Law was delivered upon Mount <hi>Sinai, Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>it was ordained in the hand of a Mediator,</hi> or a middle perſon that ſtood and tranſacted between God and the people, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.38. <hi>who received the lively Oracles to give unto us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by Jeſus Chriſt the Goſpel is publiſhed. In this reſpect he is the Mediator of a better Teſtament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> gave the moral, judicial and ceremonial Laws.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt reveals the Goſpel and Goſpel-Worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> appoints the Paſſover, Sacrifices, builds the Tabernacle made with hands.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt gives the Lords Supper, a moſt lively Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf and his own Death, the true Sacrifice: And he is himſelf alſo the true Temple and Tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched, and not Man: ſo that Chriſt hath the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in all things, inaſmuch as Goſpel-worſhip excels Legal worſhip, and Truth and Subſtance excels Figures and Shadows.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Moſes</hi> did mediate between God and the people as an Interceſſor by his Prayers and Supplications, and did prevail for them, for the Deſtruction of <hi>Amalek, Exod.</hi> 17. And again, when they murmured upon the evil Report of the Spies, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.12,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96313:67"/>
13, 20— and when they made the molten Calf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.10, 11, 14. then with much wreſtling he prevailed with the Lord for them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.23. Moſes <hi>ſtood in the breach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So doth Chriſt intercede, and pleads for us with the Father, when we provoke him by our Sins, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1, 2. yea, <hi>he lives for ever to intercede,</hi> Heb. 7.25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Moſes</hi> his Sufferings and Conflicts in the Diſcharge of his Truſt, and Exerciſe of his Office, had in them a Shadow of the like to be undergone by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> faſted forty days and forty nights in the Mount.</p>
               <p>So did Chriſt in the Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> ſuffered many Contradictions both from his Enemies and from his Friends, profeſſed Enemies, <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> and the Magicians of <hi>Egypt,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. His Friends, the people to whom he was ſent rejected him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.14. often murmured at him, <hi>forty years he bore their manners, Acts</hi> 13.18. yea his neereſt friends ſometimes, <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Chriſt, he was <hi>rejected of the Builders,</hi> Pſal. 118.22. <hi>came to his own, and his own received him not,</hi> Joh. 1.11. His own Diſciples ſometimes thought his Doctrines hard ſayings; as when he ſpake againſt Divorces, they thought a man had better never be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, than ſubmit to ſuch a yoke: and all along how weak and wayward were they? But the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> like <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> openly reſiſted and oppoſed his Doctrine and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lords owning and bearing witneſs to him by Miracles, Signs and Wonders, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>So to Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Acts</hi> 2.22. <hi>a man approved of God among you, by Miracles, Wonders and Signs</hi>— ſome note in all about five and forty of them recorded by the four Evangeliſts, and wrought in the three years and an half of his publik Miniſtry, <hi>viz.</hi> three in his firſt year, nineteen in his ſecond year, and thirteen in his third year, and ten in his laſt half year, before <hi>Judas</hi> betrayed him; beſides thoſe at his Death, and after his Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Only there were theſe two differences between <hi>Moſes</hi> his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Chriſts.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:96313:68"/>1. That <hi>Moſes</hi> his Miracles were wrought in Chriſts Name: but Chriſts Miracles were wrought in his own Name.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>Moſes</hi> his Miracles had more of Terror and Majeſty; Chriſts more of Love and Sweetneſs. Chriſt ſeldom wrought any Mirales for the hurt of his Enemies in a way of righteous Wrath and Judgment; but ordinarily only for the help both of Friends and Enemies: as for inſtance, the healing of <hi>Malchus</hi> his Ear. I remember but two Miracles wrought by Jeſus Chriſt in a way of Wrath and Puniſhment againſt his Enemies, the ſuffering the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to enter into the <hi>Gadarenes Swine,</hi> and cauſing his Enemies to fall backward, when they came to apprehend him.</p>
               <p>All the reſt were Miracles of Mercy and Kindneſs: But by the Hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> there were no leſs than ten miraculous Plagues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Egypt.</hi> There were Thunderings and Lightnings at <hi>Mount Sinai.</hi> The Earth opened her mouth upon <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and ſwallowed them up quick, with other ſuch dreadful and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things in righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this difference was, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Law, which is a voice of Words, and Terror, and Fear, and genders unto Bondage; but Jeſus Chriſt is the Miniſter and Author of the Goſpel, which is Grace and Peace: Therefore theſe two different kinds of Diſpenſations were atteſted with two different kinds of Miracles. But as to the general, the working of Miracles by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo being owned by the Lord, and born witneſs to by him, herein there was a reſemblance and prefigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what was done by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Type of Chriſt in the end and cloſe of his Life, <hi>viz.</hi> in his Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcention into Heaven. He dyed willingly, he went up to <hi>Mount Nebo,</hi> which was a part of <hi>Mount Abarim,</hi> and there ſurrendred up his Soul.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt, <hi>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf, no man taketh it from me:</hi> ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. <hi>I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</hi> He went to Mount <hi>Golgotha,</hi> and there gave up his Soul to his Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> after his Death and Burial roſe again; buried he was, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.6. and that he roſe again, and aſcended into Heaven,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96313:68"/>
may be gathered from <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. For he did appear and talk with Chriſt at his Transfiguration, together with <hi>Elias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So you know Jeſus Chriſt roſe again from the dead, and aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Heaven.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Type of Chriſt all along. In his Birth, in his perſonal Qualifications, in the whole courſe of his Life, his Office, his Sufferings, his Miracles, and finally in his Death, Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Aſcenſion into Heaven.</p>
               <p>But yet though there was ſuch a full analogy, and ſo great a reſemblance between them; yet there was a diſparity; Chriſt having the preheminence above <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 3.5, 6. Moſes <hi>was faithful as a Servant in his Lords Houſe: but Chriſt as a Son in his own Houſe</hi>— Thus much as to <hi>Moſes</hi>—</p>
               <p>Now for <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> his Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>That he was a Type appears, becauſe Chriſt was called by that name in the <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Joſhuah</hi> is called Jeſus in the <hi>Greek,</hi> in the New Teſtament, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.45. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.8. that is, a Saviour; though he be but a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Saviour: Chriſt a ſpiritual Saviour, Author of eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>The Analogy appears chiefly in five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Joſhuah</hi> brought the people into <hi>Canaan</hi> after <hi>Moſes</hi> his death, which <hi>Moſes</hi> could not do being alive: He divided the Land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, aſſigning to every one his Portion.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt brings us to Heaven, which the Law could not do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> went in himſelf before them.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt to Heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. <hi>I go to prepare a place for you; in my Fathers Houſe are many Manſions,</hi> Heb. 6. ult. <hi>whither the Forerunner is entred for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as when <hi>Joſhuah</hi> did this, the Cloud and Manna ceaſed, which had been in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time. Of the Manna it is expreſſed, and the time when, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.12. of the Pillar of Cloud and Fire, that it did ceaſe is evident by many paſſages afterwards in the ſacred Hiſtory; but the time when is not ſet down. Probably it might be after they had paſſed <hi>Jordan,</hi> being divided by the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96313:69"/>
Ark, and were on ſhoar on the other ſide: So ſhall Ordinances ceaſe when we come to Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. God himſelf is inſtead of all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Joſhuah</hi> was a Type of Chriſt in regard of the Miracles wrought by him; we read of three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He divided <hi>Jordan, Joſh.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>But herein, as in all things, Chriſt hath the preheminence; for Chriſt in the ſame <hi>Jordan</hi> divides the Heavens when he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>And he commanded the Winds and Seas, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the waters, as upon dry ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Moreover, <hi>Joſhuah</hi> threw down the Walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi> by the ſounding of Rams Horns, a weak and an unlikely means for ſo great a Work, yea ridiculous and contemptible in the eye of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6. but it was done by Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.30.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt by the Fooliſhneſs of Preaching ſubdueth Souls unto himſelf, and throws down ſtrong holds, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Joſhua</hi> did it again and again, ſix days, ſeven days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Walls fell.</p>
               <p>So it is in the preaching of the Goſpel: There muſt be Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity in that work; Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept; and at laſt the ſtrong holds are won, and the Sinner ſubdued unto the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Joſhuah</hi> commanded the Sun to ſtand ſtill, till he had ſlain his Enemies, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.12, 13— <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>and there was no day like that, before it, or after it, that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Jeſus Chriſt, when fighting with Principalities and Powers upon the Croſs, <hi>Matth</hi> 27.45. <hi>when the Sun was aſhamed, and the Moon confounded, and all the Angels in Heaven ſtood agaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how great a Perſon this <hi>Joſhuah</hi> was, in that all the Creatures, all the Elements obeyed him; the Earth, the Walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> proſtrate themſelves and fell before him, the Waters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Jordan</hi> were at his Command, yea the Heavens alſo, the Sun and Moon obeyed him: <hi>thus God magnified him in the ſight of all</hi> Iſrael, as it is ſaid, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 4.14.</p>
               <p>But behold a greater than <hi>Joſhuah</hi> is here: For it is ſaid of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:96313:69"/>
Chriſt, That <hi>God hath given him a Name above every Name,</hi> Phil. 2.9. <hi>that in the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow; of things in Heaven, and things in Earth, and things under the Earth,</hi> ver. 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Joſhuah</hi> was a Type of Chriſt in regard of his Conqueſts and Victories over his Enemies: We read of five Kings at once ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by him, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10. and he bids his Captains tread upon their Necks, and <hi>cap.</hi> 12. of one and thirty Kings which he ſmote; yet notwithſtanding there were ſome few Enemies left, though weak and inconſiderable: but not one that durſt or could oppoſe or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the publick peace of Gods people; yet they were left for a time, for their good, leaſt the wild Beaſts ſhould multiply upon them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.22.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt Jeſus is a mighty Conqueror, he ſubdueth all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of his people: ſee him deſcribed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>conquering and to conquer,</hi> not only five, nor one and thirty, but thouſands of them. One man was poſſeſt with a Legion of Devils; but they are all caſt forth by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And as Chriſt, ſo his Followers are as <hi>Joſhuahs,</hi> Conquerors with and through him: and he gives Believers to tread upon the necks of their own Luſts, and of the Devils Temptations: yet however there be ſome <hi>Canaanites</hi> left in the Land; ſome Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the Hearts of Gods people in this Life to exerciſe their Graces and to keep them humble; which yet, if it be not through their own careleſs negligence, ſhall not diſturb their Peace with God.</p>
               <p>But there were ſome Enemies that were devoted unto everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ruine, and Deſtruction irrecoverable by <hi>Joſhuah</hi> in the ſpirit of Propheſie, <hi>viz. Jericho,</hi> cap 6.26. which Curſe did not fall to the ground, but was fulfilled in <hi>Hiel</hi> the <hi>Bethelite,</hi> 1 King. 16.34. a ſhadow of the irreparable Ruines, and everlaſting Deſtruction of all the implacable Enemies of God and his people, and eſpecially <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt, Rev.</hi> 18.21. Babylon <hi>ſhall be caſt down, like a Milſtone into the Sea, never to riſe more.</hi> The Curſe of Chriſt will fall upon ſuch as endeavour to reſtore <hi>Rome</hi> again, and raiſe up the Ruines that he hath brought upon it. For it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted by our Lord Jeſus, the true <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> to irreparable everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:96313:70"/>4. Though <hi>Joſhuah</hi> conquered and deſtroyed reſiſting Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; yet he ſaved thoſe who ſubmitted themſelves; as <hi>Rahab</hi> and the <hi>Gibeonites; Rahab</hi> cap. 6. the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> cap. 9. Though they acted very ſinfully, they came out of ſlaviſh fear, and they diſſembled: but yet they did ſubmit themſelves.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt reſiſts the proud; but gives Grace to the humble, that yield up themſelves unto him; though there be a mixture of much ſlaviſh Fear, and ſinful Selfiſhneſs and Unbelief in their ſo doing, as <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Joſhuah</hi> gave them reſt, fulfilling and accompliſhing all the good promiſed, <hi>cap.</hi> 21.45. and 23.14. <hi>Joſhuah</hi> appeals to all their Knowledges and Conſciences about it.</p>
               <p>So when we come to Heaven, we ſhall ſee the Truth and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God; we ſhall have all the Promiſes accompliſhed through Chriſt the <hi>true Joſhuah;</hi> and be able to ſay with Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, <hi>not a word hath failed;</hi> and all through Chriſt the true <hi>Joſhuah: For in him all the Promiſes are Yea and</hi> Amen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>and this will be Reſt for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As they had Reſt; ſo now Believers enter into an everlaſting Reſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>But yet withal there is a great diſparity between Chriſt and <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> and the Reſt they bring their Followers into <hi>Joſhuah</hi> brought them but into a ſtate of outward Reſt, in the Land of Promiſe; but this was not the true Reſt: But Chriſt gives us an higher Reſt in Heaven, by bringing us into a ſtate of Grace and Glory.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how eminently <hi>Joſhuah</hi> was a Type of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Grecians</hi> commonly turning all into Fables, <hi>Graecia Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dax;</hi> and being great pretenders to Antiquity, being as drunk with the Pride of that Pretence though as falſe) as the Papiſts are at this day; and therefore making their own Country the Scene and the Stage of every wonderful thing (as ſome have well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of them); they report of <hi>Niſus</hi> the King of <hi>Megaris</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> that he had on his head a purple Hair, on which the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his Life and Kingdom did depend, which Jewel his Daughter <hi>Scylla</hi> is ſaid to have delivered unto King <hi>Minos,</hi> her Fathers Enemy, with whom ſhe fell in Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of which Fables it may be ſaid, <hi>Fabula fundatur in Hiſtoria,</hi> theſe Fables ſeem to be founded in the Hiſtory of antient times.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Sampſon</hi> was a godly man, it is certain, becauſe he is num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongſt thoſe eminent Believers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>That he was a Type of Chriſt appears by the clearneſs of the Analogy between him and the <hi>Antitype;</hi> and there ſeemeth to be ſome intimation of it in <hi>Jacobs</hi> Propheſie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. of which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>And indeed the Analogy is ſo clear, that I meet with none that have written of the <hi>Types,</hi> but takes notice of <hi>Sampſon</hi> for one; ſo doth alſo <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was a Type in regard of his Death and Sufferings; yet not in that only; but chiefly, as being moſt peculiar and ſignal to him, both above other Types, and above other reſpects wherein himſelf was a Type: For there were other reſpects alſo, beſides this, which I ſhall touch upon, and ſo come to this as the main.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sampſon</hi> therefore was a Type of Chriſt in four reſpects.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In regard of ſundry paſſages and circumſtances of his Birth.</item>
                  <item>2. in ſome ſpecial Actions of his Life.</item>
                  <item>3. In his Strength and Victories over his Enemies.</item>
                  <item>4. In his Sufferings, and in the Victoriouſneſs of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:96313:71"/>1. The firſt Analogy between Chriſt and him is, in ſome paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges about his Birth. The time of it, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was under great Oppreſſion by the <hi>Philiſtines, Judges</hi> 13.1. then <hi>Sampſon</hi> aroſe like a little Sun, as his Name imports <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Soliculus</hi> or <hi>Sol parvus,</hi> from <hi>Shemeſh, Sol,</hi> and gave them ſome dawnings of the Day, ſome beginnings of Light and Liberty in that deep night of Darkneſs and Bondage.</p>
               <p>Anſwerably Jeſus Chriſt appeared when the <hi>Jews</hi> were under the yoke of the <hi>Romans</hi> and both they and the whole world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpiritual thraldom of Sin and <hi>Satan.</hi> The <hi>Pagan</hi> world overwhelmed in Idolatry and ignorance of God, the <hi>Jews</hi> dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated into Formality and a ſpirit of Bondage: then did this true Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe with healing in his Wings.</p>
               <p>His Birth was beyond the ordinary courſe of Nature. And ſo was Chriſts: For <hi>Sampſons</hi> Mother was barren, the Mother of Chriſt a Virgin.</p>
               <p>It was foretold, together with his Office, to his Mother by an Angel, and confirmed by a Sign.</p>
               <p>And ſo was Chriſts.</p>
               <p>His Office was to begin to deliver <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the <hi>Philiſtines, Judg.</hi> 13.5.</p>
               <p>Chriſts to ſave his people from their Sins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21.</p>
               <p>The Sign to <hi>Sampſons</hi> Mother was the Angels appearing again, and aſcending in a flame of Fire, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.20.</p>
               <p>The Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> had the Meſſage confirmed alſo by a Sign, though not ſo terrible a Sign as this: But the Angels acquainting her with her Couſin <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Conception, and the Babe leaping in her Womb, and ſhe breaking forth into thoſe bleſſed expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>Bleſſed art thou among Women, and bleſſed is the Fruit of thy Womb, and whence is this, that the Mother of my Lord ſhould come unto me,</hi> Luke 1.36, 42, 43.</p>
               <p>Moreover, they were both <hi>Nazarites</hi> from the Womb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sampſon</hi> by the Law of <hi>Nazarites, Numb.</hi> 6.2.</p>
               <p>Chriſt by ſpecial Sanctity fulfilling that Type; <hi>that holy thing that ſhall be born of thee,</hi> Luke 1.35.</p>
               <p>As alſo by the place of his Reſidence, being born indeed at <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:96313:71"/>
but bred at <hi>Nazareth, Matth.</hi> 2.1, 5, 23. and thence called a <hi>Nazaren,</hi> or a <hi>Nazarite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a ſecond Analogy between Chriſt and <hi>Sampſon</hi> in ſome ſpecial Actions of his Life.</p>
               <p>As in his Marriage with a <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> and the Text ſaith, <hi>it was of the Lord;</hi> therefore ſome think that his firſt Match was not ſinful; but that he had a ſpecial Diſpenſation for it, <hi>Judg.</hi> 14.4.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt took a Spouſe unto himſelf out of the Gentiles, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.20.</p>
               <p>At his Marriage <hi>Sampſon</hi> put forth his Mind in Parables and Riddles to the <hi>Philiſtines, Judg.</hi> 14.12.</p>
               <p>And ſo did Chriſt to the <hi>Phariſees, Matth.</hi> 13.34.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a third Analogy, in their Strength and Victories over their Enemies, eſpecially in this circumſtance; That <hi>Sampſon</hi> wrought his Victories alone, by his own perſonal Strength, his Countrymen would not ſtand by him, <hi>Judg.</hi> 15.10, 11, 12,</p>
               <p>So Chriſt trod the Wine-preſs alone, when all forſook him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sampſons</hi> firſt exploit was, the ſlaying of a Lyon in the Deſart, that roared upon him, <hi>Judg.</hi> 14.6.</p>
               <p>So the firſt Work of Chriſt at his entrance into his Miniſtry was, the conquering that roaring Lyon that aſſaulted and tempted him in the Wilderneſs, and roared upon him with thoſe three hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous Temptations, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>And as upon the Lyon <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſlew, he gave this Riddle; <hi>Out of the Eater came forth Meat, and out of the ſtrong came Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>ex Corpore Diaboli myſtico,</hi> out of the Devils Body, being ſlain, out of the Devils Deſtruction comes the ſweet and bleſſed tidings of the Goſpel; and Flocks, or Churches, or Societies of Chriſtians, like ſo many Swarms of Bees. The Saints were onco in an unregenerate condition, Children of Wrath, Limbs of <hi>Satan;</hi> but <hi>Satan</hi> being ſlain and conquered, they are transformed; and it is as great a change, as for a Bee to be bred of a dead Carkaſs.</p>
               <p>Some Interpreters have obſerved,<note place="margin">Engliſh Annot. on Judg. <hi>14.8.</hi>
                  </note> that this was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary: For Naturaliſts obſerve, that Bees do not uſe to breed in the Carkaſs of a Lyon; but rather of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:96313:72"/>
an Ox or Bullock. We may apply it to the Diſpenſations of Providence. God works by unlikely, yea contrary means; Meat out of the Eater. The <hi>Canaanites,</hi> our Enemies, they are Bread for us, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.9. their very Sins, Corruptions, Temptations, the Lord in his unſearchable Wiſdom produceth good out of them; Light out of Darkneſs, yea Life out of Death, out of the Death of the Lord of Life.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſlew a thouſand men with the Jaw-bone of an Aſs, a very weak and unable and unlikely Inſtrument to effect ſuch a Work by; yet the Spirit of the Lord coming upon him, what ſlaughter doth he make! <hi>Judg.</hi> 15.14, 15.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt by the Fooliſhneſs of Preaching, through the Power of his Spirit, ſubdues and overcomes the Souls of men unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſlays the Enmity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth Analogy between Chriſt and <hi>Sampſon</hi> is, in his Sufferings, and the Victoriouſneſs thereof againſt his Enemies, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially his Death; I ſay <hi>Sampſon</hi> was made like unto the Son of God, in regard of his Sufferings from his Enemies.</p>
               <p>Some have ſummed them up briefly thus.</p>
               <p>That they were both ſold for Mony, under pretence of Love, apprehended by their Enemies, led away bound, brought forth at a great Feaſt, blinded, (Chriſt was blindfolded) ſcorned, faſtned to a Poſt, offered themſelves willingly to death, died amongſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, and thereby deſtroyed the Power of the Churches Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>And as there were many circumſtances in his Death, which did evidently prefigure what befel the Antitype: ſo let me deſire you to take notice of theſe three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it was voluntary: ſo Chriſt, <hi>no man taketh it from me,</hi> Joh. 10.18. <hi>I lay it down of my ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That it was by his Enemies, not a natural Death, but vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: ſo was Chriſts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That he was victorious in his Death, he did ſuffer, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, yea he conquered in and by his Sufferings: <hi>he ſlew more at his Death, than in his Life,</hi> Judg. 16.30.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt by his Death gave the moſt deadly blow to <hi>Satans</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:96313:72"/>
Kingdom, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>In his Death he ſpoiled Principalities and Powers.</hi> This propheſied of by <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 49.16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sampſon</hi> was a Serpent, by the way to the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> in the Foxes, and in the Jaw-bone of an Aſs: and the Pillars of the Houſe are compared by ſome to the Heels of the Horſe whereupon three thouſand <hi>Philiſtines</hi> rode and fell backwards.</p>
               <p>And I have waited for thy Salvation, ſaith <hi>Jacob,</hi> that is, for Chriſt, whom in the Spirit of Propheſie, he ſaw afar off.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when he was in <hi>Azzah,</hi> when the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> thought they had him ſure enough, he roſe at midnight, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.3.</p>
               <p>So when the Enemies thought they had Chriſt ſure enough, he aroſe in his might, carried away the Gates and Bars of Death, and broke the Bonds of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>David,</hi> that he was a Type appears by this, that Chriſt is called by his Name, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.23, 24. <hi>My Servant</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>ſhall reign over them for evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sampſon</hi> began, <hi>David</hi> went on with the Work.</p>
               <p>See the Analogy between <hi>David</hi> and Chriſt in theſe four par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He was eminently ſitted for the Work, to rule, to feed Gods people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though he was the meaneſt of his Family.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt came when the Family was brought low into obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> was eminent for Holineſs, a man after Gods own heart.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt, holy, harmleſs and undefiled, ſeparate from Sinners.</p>
               <p>A perſon of ſuch worth, that the Story of his Life is more fully and largely recorded in holy Writ, than any other perſon in all the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt is the perſon treated of throughout the whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> beloved of God.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>this is my beloved Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He had many Enemies both open and ſecret, <hi>Saul, Doeg</hi> and <hi>Achitophel,</hi> treacherous Dealers, Types of <hi>Judas,</hi> who dealt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly with him; and for open profeſſed Enemies, the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines,</hi> and the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and the <hi>Syrians</hi> engaged by the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:96313:73"/>
                  <hi>Ammonites,</hi> ſee 2 <hi>Samuel</hi> 10.6. and 2 <hi>Samuel</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>So had Jeſus Chriſt the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> Men and Devils for his Enemies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His Kingdom had but ſmall and weak beginnings; firſt a Shepherd, then an Officer in <hi>Sauls</hi> Army, then an Exile with a matter of ſix hundred men, afterward King over <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> at <hi>Hebron,</hi> laſtly King over all <hi>Iſrael</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Kingdom of Chriſt grows from ſmall beginnings; it is therefore compared to a grain of Muſtard Seed: It is at firſt like a River breaking forth at the Foot of a Mountain in a little Stream, that you may ſtride over it: but in its progreſs it enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and grows to a deep and broad River, and at laſt ends in the Ocean, as all Rivers do: ſo doth the Kingdom of Grace in the Ocean of eternal Glory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Glorious Succeſſes, and Victories, and Deliverances, all his Enemies fell before him. He ſlew the Bear, the Lyon, <hi>Goliah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.37. conquered all his Enemies round about, ſee 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.12, 14.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Saul</hi> and his bloody Houſe were rooted out before him: He never fell into his Enemies hands; though in this there is ſome diſſimilitude.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt was content to yield up himſelf into their hands, to let them try their Strength, and do their worſt upon him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gave up himſelf to Death: But he roſe again from under the power of Death, and prevailed againſt them all; and after his Reſurrection Death hath no more dominion over him. All his Enemies ſhall fall and periſh ſooner or later; but he ſhall reign for ever and ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Solomon;</hi> I ſhall but mention a threefold Analogy between Chriſt and him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In his perſonal Wiſdom, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.29, 30.</p>

               <p>Some obſerve, that the Daughter of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> never ſeduced him; neither is there any mention made of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Idols, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.5, 7.

               <p>He took others beſides <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter. For ſhe was a Proſelyte, and ſo it was no ſin to marry her.</p>
               <p>And the Love between her and <hi>Solomon</hi> is made a Type of the Love between Chriſt and the Church.</p>
               <p>Chriſt hath took us Gentiles to be a Spouſe unto him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.</p>

               <p>This is the difference between Chriſts Peace and Satans Peace; for they both give Peace to their ſubjects.: But Satans Peace is a Peace of freedom from trouble, and of ſinful ſecurity in ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:96313:74"/>Chriſts Peace is a Peace after and out of trouble, by War and Victory over Sin and ſpiritual Enemies, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9.3. His Servants rejoyce as thoſe that divide the ſpoil after the Victory.</p>

                  <hi>THe third Conjunction or Conglebation of typical Perſons under the Law, is thoſe three Prophets,</hi> Elijah, Eliſha <hi>and</hi> Jonah, whom I put together, becauſe <hi>Elijah</hi> was a Type of Chriſts Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion into Heaven, and <hi>Eliſha</hi> of the Continuance of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Spirit in his Apoſtles and Meſſengers ever ſince, and <hi>Jonah</hi> of his Death and Sufferings the procuring cauſe of all.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>Elijah,</hi> that great Prophet. I confeſs he is omitted by many that have written of the <hi>Types,</hi> and indeed by all that I have ſeen. I know not well, how it comes to paſs.</p>
               <p>But that he was a <hi>Type,</hi> is certain, becauſe <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt is called by his Name; therefore he was a Type,
<list>
                     <item>1. Of <hi>John.</hi> Yea,</item>
                     <item>2. Of Chriſt himſelf.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He was a Type of the Meſſiahs Harbinger and Forerunner <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt. For <hi>the Types</hi> (as hath been often hinted) are not to be reſtrained always only to the Perſon of Chriſt himſelf; but all the things of Chriſt were typified to them of old. There were Types of all New Teſtament Diſpenſations; therefore <hi>John</hi> is called <hi>Elijah, Mal.</hi> 4.2 laſt <hi>v.</hi> and Chriſt himſelf explains it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.14.</p>
               <p>But why is <hi>John</hi> called <hi>Elias?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not that he was <hi>Elijah</hi> perſonally, but myſtically; he roſe up
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96313:74"/>
in the Spirit and Power of <hi>Elijah:</hi> So <hi>Elijah</hi> was <hi>John</hi> in a Type or Figure. <hi>John</hi> was <hi>Elijah</hi> in Spirit and Power, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.17. There was ſomething of Analogy in his very outward Garb and Deportment, <hi>an hairy man,</hi> 2 King. 1.8. that is, in regard of his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit or Clothing; <hi>in a rough hairy Garment:</hi> So <hi>John, Matth.</hi> 3.4. <hi>a Girdle of Hair;</hi> but chiefly in regard of his Spririt and inward Endowments, and of his Work and Office, to convert and recall a backſliden Generation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Elijah</hi> was a Type of Chriſt himſelf. And that he was ſo, will be very evident, if you do conſider how great a Perſon this <hi>Elijah</hi> was, in three reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His eminent and heroick Spirit of Holineſs, and invincible Courage and Activity for God. His very Name ſignifies <hi>God the Lord, Elijah</hi> or <hi>Elijahu</hi> in the Hebrew, <hi>Elias</hi> in the Greek in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>He abode with God when almoſt all the world forſook him, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.10. he reduced and brought back the people, <hi>cap.</hi> 18.39. he was a man mighty in Prayer, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.17, 18. a man of an invincible Courage, who feared not to ſtand himſelf alone againſt four hundred Prophets, and againſt <hi>Ahab</hi> the King, and <hi>Jezabel</hi> the Queen, whoſe Chaplains theſe falſe Prophets were: He is brought forth in the ſacred Hiſtory not unlike <hi>Melchizedek, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Father or Mother, without either Birth or Death,</hi> 1 King. 17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The great and wonderful Miracles wrought by him, there be twelve recorded in the Hiſtory of him in the firſt and ſecond Books of Kings.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His ſhutting up the Windows of Heaven, that there ſhould be no Rain for three years and an half, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. whence ſome have called him <hi>Fraenum Caeli,</hi> the Bridle of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His being fed by a Raven morning and evening at the Brook <hi>Cherith</hi> beſide <hi>Jordan.</hi> This was the effect of his Faith and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and may be reckoned amongſt his Miracles;<note place="margin">Engliſh Annot.</note> not that it is likely that he did eat raw Fleſh, but rather that God by his Providence directed the Ravens to the places where they might have it, as to ſome rich mens Kitchens, or the like.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:96313:75"/>3. His miraculous Supply of the Widow of <hi>Zarephath,</hi> called <hi>Sarepta</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> 4.26. <hi>that her Barrel of Meal waſted not, nor did the Cruiſe of Oyl fail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. His raiſing of her Son from the dead, by ſtretching himſelf upon the Child. This was the firſt perſon we read of in Scripture that was raiſed from the dead, and <hi>Elijahs</hi> fourth Miracle. All theſe are recorded in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In fetching down Fire from Heaven upon his Sacrifice, to confound the Prieſts of <hi>Baal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. His opening the Windows of Heaven, and fetching down Rain after he had done juſtice upon the Prieſts of <hi>Baal;</hi> theſe two are in <hi>cap.</hi> 18. he did this alſo by Prayer, and by perſevering in Prayer, <hi>cap.</hi> 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 43.</p>
               <p n="7">7. His faſting forty days and forty nights, <hi>cap.</hi> 19.8. In Mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> and in his Journey thither and back again, the place where God appeared to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 3.1, 2. and where he gave the Law to <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 4.10, 14.</p>
               <p>Never any man faſted forty days, beſides this <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Exod.</hi> 34.28. and Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.2.</p>
               <p>Herein both <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> were manifeſt Prefigurations of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. This was <hi>Elijahs</hi> ſeventh Miracle.</p>
               <p n="8">8. His calling the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and cauſing him to follow him, by caſting his Mantle upon him, which had ſuch an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that he left all and followed him; therefore this may be put into the Catalogue of his Miracles, <hi>cap.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>And in the like miraculous influence of the Spirit did Chriſt call his Apoſtles to leave all and follow him.</p>
               <p>His ninth and tenth Miracles were the Deſtruction of the two Captains and their Fifties, when <hi>Ahaziah</hi> ſent to take him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1.1. they both periſhed alike. For like Sins pull down like Judgments.</p>
               <p>The 11th was the dividing of <hi>Jordan</hi> by his Mantle, that he and <hi>Eliſha</hi> might paſs over, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>And the 12. was his Aſcenſion into Heaven in a Chariot of Fire, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.11. a Prerogative that never any man had but himſelf, and <hi>Enoch</hi> before the Law, and <hi>Moſes</hi> who gave the Law; but
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96313:75"/>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> died firſt, and was tranſlated afterwards, as hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſhewed. They were all three eminent Types herein of Chriſt his Aſcenſion into Heaven.</p>
               <p>They that are faithful and zealous for God in times of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Apoſtacy, the Lord is wont to own them in a ſpecial manner, and to put ſpecial Honour upon them one way or other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His commiſſionating Succeſſors after him to carry on the Work of God when he was gone, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.15, 16. <hi>Eliſha</hi> to be Prophet. <hi>Hazael</hi> King of <hi>Syria, Jehu</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Chriſt ſends forth his Apoſtles and Miniſters, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. ſome that are godly, and ſometimes he imploys others that are not godly, but only gifted, and makes ſome uſe of them, as he did of <hi>Jehu,</hi> and of <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Demas</hi> for a time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Eliſha,</hi> called in the New Teſtament <hi>Elizeus, Luk.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>He was a Type of Chriſt in three reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that <hi>Eliſha</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Elijah,</hi> was, as it were, a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the ſame perſon: For he roſe up compleatly in the ſame Spirit. The Prophets diſcerned it, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.15. the Spirit of <hi>Elijah</hi> did reſt upon <hi>Eliſha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So when Chriſt departed and aſcended up to Heaven, he left the Comforter in his ſtead, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. and he left the Apoſtles and Miniſters to carry on his Work, and poured forth his Spirit upon them for that end.</p>
               <p>Or we may accommodate this with reſpect to <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, thus. As <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Elijah;</hi> ſo did Chriſt come after <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt: and ſo <hi>Eliſha</hi> was in this reſpect a Type of Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of the remarkable Vengeance and Deſtruction that came upon his wicked Enemies.</p>
               <p>The Children that mocked him were devoured by two She-Bears, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.23, 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gehazi</hi> his treacherous Servant ſmitten with Leproſie, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.27.</p>
               <p>So Deſpiſers of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Goſpel, ſhall be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with moſt remarkable and dreadful Deſtruction; <hi>Hear ye De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers, and wonder, and periſh,</hi> Acts 13.41. For I work a Work in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96313:76"/>
your days, a Work which you ſhall in no wiſe believe, though a man declare it unto you; incredible Plagues ſhall the Deſpiſers and Rejecters of Chriſt, and of the Goſpel, be puniſhed with.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Judas</hi> the Traytor, his Servant, you know what dreadful Deſtruction came upon him, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.18. his Bowels guſhed out, through the horror of his Conſcience, and the Fury of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty rending his very Body in pieces, as well as his Soul from his Body.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard of his Miracles.</p>
               <p>He and his Predeceſſor <hi>Elijah</hi> were the greateſt workers of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles (except <hi>Moſes</hi>) that ever we read of in Scripture, or that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Lord raiſed up in his Church. For <hi>Moſes</hi> was to be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as it were of that Church-Eſtate and Worſhip that was in thoſe days: and <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> were the Preſervers and Reſtorers of it in a moſt degenerate and corrupted Age.</p>
               <p>The Miracles of <hi>Eliſha</hi> were very great and many; they are recorded in the ſecond Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> in the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7th. Chapters and one more in chap. 13. They were about one and twenty in all. There be three recorded in the ſecond chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> his dividing <hi>Jordan</hi> with <hi>Elijahs</hi> Mantle, his healing the Waters of <hi>Jericho,</hi> the devouring two and forty ſcoffing Children of thoſe idolatrous Parents, the people at <hi>Bethel,</hi> by two She-Bears.</p>
               <p>In the third Chapter there is another, <hi>viz.</hi> the overflowing of the Wilderneſs of <hi>Edom</hi> with Water, <hi>crp.</hi> 3.20. ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 8. to the Deſtruction of the <hi>Moabites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the fourth Chapter there be five more, which are the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis and Contents of that Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. His multiplying the Widows Oyl, while ſhe had any empty veſſels to fill.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His giving a Son to that great and good Woman the <hi>Shuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. His raiſing her Son when dead unto life again: and this is the ſecond perſon that ever was raiſed from the dead.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His healing the deadly Pottage, which had poyſoned the Students in <hi>the Colledge at</hi> Gilgal.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His feeding of an hundred men with twenty Loaves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:96313:76"/>In the fifth Chapter there be two more, the curing of <hi>Naamans</hi> Leproſie, and the ſmiting of <hi>Gehazi</hi> with that Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>In the ſixth Chapter there be ſix more.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His cauſing Iron to ſwim.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His diſcloſing the ſecret Counſels of the <hi>King of Syria</hi> by the Spirit of Propheſie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An Army of Angels coming down from Heaven for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at <hi>Dothan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The opening of his Servants Eyes to ſee them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſmiting of the <hi>Syrians</hi> with Blindneſs. And</p>
               <p n="6">6. The opening their Eyes again.</p>
               <p>In the ſeventh Chapter are three more, the hideous which noiſe was heard, and cauſed ſuch a pannick terror in the Camp of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> that their whole Army fled; and the incredible Plenty in <hi>Samaria;</hi> with the Death of that unbelieving Nobleman who had queſtioned whether God could do it.</p>
               <p>And then laſtly, <hi>cap.</hi> 13.21. a dead man is reſtored to life by touching his Bones. And this is the third perſon that was raiſed from the dead.</p>
               <p>All theſe Miracles in general were Preſignifications of what the Meſſiah was to do in that kind: and ſome of them were more particularly fulfilled and anſwered by the <hi>Antitype.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As that of feeding an hundred men with twenty Loaves.</p>
               <p>You know Chriſt did that and more, feeding five thouſand with five Loaves and two Fiſhes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.21.</p>
               <p>And at another time four thouſand with ſeven Loaves and a few little Fiſhes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.38.</p>
               <p>His raiſing the dead to life, whereof we have three inſtances in the Old Teſtament, the Widow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> her Son, the <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namites</hi> Son, and the Man buried in <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Grave. Theſe were Types and Pledges of what Chriſt ſhould do in raiſing the dead.</p>
               <p>As in raiſing <hi>Lazarus, Jairus</hi> his Daughter, the Widows Son of <hi>Naim;</hi> and his own bleſſed Body out of the Grave, and many Saints that aroſe with him.</p>
               <p>And thoſe which the Apoſtles raiſed by his Name.</p>
               <p>And finally, the raiſing all his Elect unto eternal Life, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96313:77"/>
all the Sons of men unto Judgment at the great Day.</p>
               <p>There might alſo be a ſpiritual application and accommodation of them, as to the quickning of mens Souls, the healing of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the Soul, feeding them with the Bread of Life, pouring into empty Veſſels, empty Souls, the Oyl of Gladneſs, the Joys and Graces of his Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Jonah,</hi> him I connect with <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> to make the Type more compleat and full.</p>
               <p>Some have conjectured that <hi>Jonah</hi> was the Widows Son of <hi>Zarephath,</hi> whom <hi>Elijah</hi> raiſed from the dead, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.22, 23. but this is but a conjecture without proof: it is probable enough he might live about their time, or perhaps ſomewhat after.</p>
               <p>That he was a Type of Chriſt, the Scripture is expreſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.39. <hi>No Sign ſhall be given them, but the Sign of the Prophet</hi> Jonah.</p>
               <p>You may ſee how the <hi>Type</hi> fits the <hi>Antitype</hi> in four reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In his Death; he offered himſelf willingly unto Death to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage the Storm, <hi>Jon.</hi> 1. and ſo he is caſt into the Sea, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the Whale.</p>
               <p>So did Chriſt, to appeaſe the Tempeſt of Gods Wrath.</p>
               <p>And as upon <hi>Jonahs</hi> being caſt into the Sea, the Sea ceaſed from its raging, <hi>cap.</hi> 1.15. and the Seamen were ſaved from drowning.</p>
               <p>So upon Chriſts Death Gods Wrath is pacified, and Believers ſaved from the Wrath to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jonah</hi> had ſore conflicts, and inward agonies of Spirit when he was under that ſhadow of death in the Whales Belly, <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>So had Chriſt when he cried, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me!</hi> there were unutterable anguiſhes in his Soul, thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, unknown, unconceivable ſufferings in his Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He was a Type of Chriſt in his Burial. For, look, as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> was buried in the Belly of the Whale three days and three nights: So was Chriſt in the Belly of the Earth the ſame ſpace, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.40.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In his Reſurrection. For, look, as <hi>Jonah</hi> overcame all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96313:77"/>
he was in, and came forth again alive out of the Whales Belly.</p>
               <p>So did Chriſt out of the Grave within three days: he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came greater Enemies, even the power of <hi>Satan,</hi> Death and Hell; and upon this ſang Praiſe to God, <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>So did Chriſt triumph; <hi>Oh Death, where is thy Sting? Oh Grave, where is thy Victory? Hoſ.</hi> 13.14. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.22, 23, 25. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.48, 49.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In his preaching after his Reſurrection. For, look, as <hi>Jonah</hi> after his Reſurrection preached Repentance to the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> and that with great ſucceſs and efficacy; for they did repent upon his preaching, the whole body of them with an outward Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and many of them doubtleſs with a true and ſaving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: and ſo were ſaved both from that preſent temporal Deſtruction, and from eternal Damnation: and <hi>Jonah</hi> did preach to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> alſo, as well as to the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.25. but which was firſt the Scripture doth not expreſs.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt, when riſen from the dead, ſent his Spirit, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Spirit in his Apoſtles and Miniſters; and not only to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſuch as thoſe <hi>Ninevites,</hi> to the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Salvation of multitudes of them, as was foretold of him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.22. and to the deeper Condemnation of Unbelievers, <hi>Matth</hi> 12.41. <hi>becauſe a greater than</hi> Jonas <hi>is here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The fourth and laſt Conjunction</hi> that I ſhall ſpeak unto, <hi>of typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Perſons under the Law, is</hi> Zerubbabel <hi>and</hi> Jehoſhuah; of whom the one was the chief Magiſtrate, the other the chief Prieſt, and both of them Rebuilders of the Temple, and Reſtorers of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed eſtate of the Church of God in thoſe times: in all which there was an eminent Praefiguration of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But what of Chriſt was ſhadowed forth by theſe two?</p>
               <p>For I ſhall put them both together, they being contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and joint inſtruments in the Work and Service of God in that Generation.</p>
               <p>There were three things of Chriſt typed and ſhadowed forth by them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Both his Offices of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prieſt. Zerubbabel</hi> was the <hi>Prince</hi> of the People of God in thoſe days, and the chief perſon
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96313:78"/>
of the Line of <hi>David.</hi> And <hi>Jehoſhuah</hi> was at the ſame time <hi>High Prieſt.</hi> And that there was ſomething of peculiar Glory in his Prieſthood, relating to Jeſus Chriſt our great High Prieſt, is not improbable. In <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. he is preſented in Viſion to the Prophet, as ſtanding before the Lord, and reſiſted by <hi>Satan,</hi> but <hi>Satan</hi> doth not prevail againſt him, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. for he is clothed with change of Raiment, <hi>ver.</hi> 4 and hath a fair Mitre ſet on his head, <hi>ver.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt, though oppoſed and reſiſted by <hi>Satan,</hi> yet went through with his Work, and had bleſſed acceptance with God, and ſucceſs therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His building the Temple, the Church of God. For theſe two did build the Temple, <hi>Ezra,</hi> 4. conjunctly each of them in their ſeveral capacities, being ſtirred up to it by the Prophet <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai,</hi> as you may ſee <hi>Hagg.</hi> 1.12, 14.</p>
               <p>And it is ſaid of <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> that as his Hands laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Temple: ſo his Hands ſhould alſo finiſh it, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.9. and the building of the Altar is aſcribed to them both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.2.</p>
               <p>So doth Chriſt ſpiritually, as the Apoſtle tells us in that very metaphor of building the Houſe of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.3, 4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His bringing back the Captivity of his People out of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bondage under Sin and Satan in their natural eſtate, and out of antichriſtian Bondage under <hi>Rome,</hi> which is myſtical <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Jehoſhuah</hi> were the Conductors and Captains of the Salvation of that People from literal <hi>Babylon, Ezra</hi> 1.5, 8. and 2.2. and 5.14.</p>
               <p>But there will be occaſion to ſpeak further to theſe things when we come to <hi>the real Types.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides the <hi>perſonal Types</hi> that have been ſpoken to, there be divers others alſo that are noted by learned men; as of the firſt Claſſis before the Law: ſome have noted <hi>Abel</hi> the <hi>Proto-martyr,</hi> as alſo <hi>Seth, Methuſelah,</hi> and <hi>Lamech Noaks</hi> Father, and <hi>Heber</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Enoch,</hi> as <hi>Enoch</hi> was the ſeventh from <hi>Adam.</hi> He was a pious man; in his Seed the primitive Language, and the true Religion and Church of God was preſerved, when the reſt of the world was loſt and fell into Idolatry: and from him
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96313:78"/>
the Church had their Denomination, <hi>Hebrews;</hi> as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have from Jeſus <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it was propheſied, that <hi>Chittim</hi> ſhould afflict <hi>Heber, Numb.</hi> 24.24. <hi>Chittim</hi> is the <hi>Romans,</hi> Chriſt is the chiefeſt of <hi>Heber,</hi> whom <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Chittim</hi> afflicted, as in other reſpects; ſo chiefly at his death: for he was crucified under <hi>Tiberius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Judah</hi> the Son of <hi>Jacob,</hi> to whom it was ſaid, <hi>Thy Fathers Sons ſhall bow down unto thee,</hi> Gen. 49.8.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>Job</hi> in his Sufferings and Patience, both unparallel'd, and his prevailing Interceſſions for his offending Friends, are by ſome looked on as <hi>Types</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And as to the ſecond Claſſis, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe <hi>under the Law,</hi> ſome have added <hi>Aaron</hi> the Prieſt of the Lord: but what might be ſaid of him, will come in when we come to handle the Office of the Prieſthood.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>Gideon</hi> and <hi>Jephtah,</hi> Judges of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet, who was a Judge alſo, and a <hi>Nazarite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah,</hi> thoſe great reforming Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eliakim, Iſai.</hi> 22.20. for the like phraſe which is there uſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. of <hi>Eliakim,</hi> is applyed to Chriſt, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.7.</p>
               <p>Some have ſet <hi>Cyrus</hi> alſo among the Types of Chriſt, the Founder of the <hi>Perſian Monarchy,</hi> who may be thought to have been a godly man, much good and no evil being recorded of him in the Scripture: and he did a very good work (and a great and glorious work it was) the breaking the Yoke of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſetting the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God at liberty, and rebuild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Temple; and indeed the Elogies and Expreſſions of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> concerning him are very high and excellent, <hi>Iſai. cap.</hi> 45. beginning, and <hi>cap.</hi> 46.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> alſo a perſon of extraordinary Eminency in his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>I do not omit theſe Perſons, as concluding they had no typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal relation to Jeſus Chriſt: For indeed I think divers of them had: But in ſome the Analogy is but weak and dark, and in ſome few particulars: and though in others it is more clear;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:96313:79"/>
yet it would have been too large to go thorough every perſon.</p>
               <p>I have thought it ſufficient to my intended ſcope, to inſtance only in ſome of the cleareſt and moſt eminent, referring the reſt to your own Meditations in the Scripture, to obſerve and improve what you find written concerning them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. See the Glory of Jeſus Chriſt the <hi>Antitype,</hi> in that ſo many excellent perſons do but weakly and imperfectly repreſent him: as if all the Candles in the world were put together, it would not equalize the Glory of the Sun: But how bright then is the Sun it ſelf, which ſhines brighter than all the Candles of the world; yea than all the Stars in the Firmament?</p>
               <p>So here how glorious is the Meſſiah, of whom all theſe were but weak and dark Umbrages? He is indeed the chiefeſt of ten thouſands, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Look whatever Glory was in any of theſe Perſons by way of Prefiguration of Jeſus Chriſt: it is and ſhould be found in every Believer by way of Participation from Chriſt and Imitation of him.</p>
               <p>Therefore in theſe Examples we ſee our own Duty; in their Attainments, we ſee what ſhould be our Endeavours: our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours did I ſay? I may ſay alſo, through Grace, our Attainments. For tho it is true, we are not yet perfect; neither have we alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy attained; yet there is a time coming, when thou and I, if we be true Believers, ſhall be more holy than ever <hi>Elijah</hi> or <hi>Eliſha</hi> were in the days of their pilgrimage here below: when we ſhall ſerve God better than <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Jehoſhuah</hi> did, when they reſtored and rebuilt his Temple; namely, when we come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Then there is not the leaſt Saint, but is more holy than ever the moſt eminent Saint was here upon Earth. For the beſt of them had a Body of Sin and Death in them: but in Heaven there ſhall be no Sin at all.</p>
               <p>For as theſe eminent Perſons had a typical relation unto Chriſt: ſo every true Believer hath a myſtical Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him: and by virtue thereof they do partake of his Spirit and Glory.</p>
               <p>So that as we have here a motive unto what we ought to do:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:96313:79"/>
ſo we have alſo Encouragement and Comfort, as to what we ſhall attain.</p>
               <p>We ſhall attain it then, <hi>when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall preſent all his Members to his Father blameleſs, and ſpotleſs, and faultleſs,</hi> Epheſ. 5.26, 27. Jude 24. <hi>before the preſence of his Glory with exceeding Joy.</hi>

               <p>THe <hi>perſonal Types</hi> of Chriſt have been referred unto two ſorts. 1. <hi>Individual Perſons.</hi> 2. <hi>Religious Orders,</hi> or whole ranks and kinds of <hi>typical Perſons.</hi> The former have been ſpoken to, we ſhall now proceed to the latter, and ſo finiſh the Text.</p>
               <p>The difference between <hi>individual Types,</hi> and <hi>religious Orders</hi> or kinds and ranks of typical Perſons lies chiefly in this, That no wicked man could be an individual Type of Chriſt; but he may be involved in a religious Order of Types: For the Order is holy, though the Man be wicked: And here it is not directly the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but rather indeed the Order that is the Type, and the Perſon as involved and inveſted in ſuch an Order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What were theſe <hi>typical Orders</hi> and Ranks of Men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall inſtance only in theſe ſix.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That whole Nation and People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The Firſt-born of that Nation.</item>
                  <item>3. Their <hi>Nazarites.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. Their Prophets.</item>
                  <item>5. Their Prieſts.</item>
                  <item>6. Their Kings.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The whole Nation of the <hi>Jews;</hi> they were a <hi>typical People;</hi> their Church-ſtate being very ceremonial and peculiar to thoſe legal times; and therefore now ceaſed and aboliſhed: and did adumbrate and ſhadow forth two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt himſelf; hence Chriſt is called <hi>Iſrael, Iſai.</hi> 49.3. By <hi>Iſrael</hi> is meant Chriſt, and all the Faithful, as the Members of him their Head.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:96313:80"/>2. They were a Type of the Church of God under the New Teſtament. Hence the Church is called <hi>Iſrael, Gal.</hi> 6.16. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. The twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are numbred up by Name to ſhew forth the Lords particular Care of every one of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in particular. That place is not meant properly of old <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe it relates to the times of the Antichriſtian Locuſts. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>cap.</hi> 7. with <hi>cap.</hi> 9.4. the Analogy lies in this, That they were a peculiar people to the Lord, choſen and ſingled out by him from all the world:</p>
               <p>So is Chriſt the Lords choſen. <hi>Behold my Servant whom I have choſen, mine elect in whom my Soul delighteth:</hi> So are all the Saints, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>A royal Nation, a peculiar People, gathered from among all Nations,</hi> Rev. 5.9. Hence the Enemies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were typical Enemies; as <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> under the Old Teſtament, <hi>Types of Antichriſtian Enemies</hi> under the New: and the Providences of God towards that People of old, Types and Shadows of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended future Diſpenſations towards his People under the New; as you will ſee further when we come to ſpeak of <hi>typical Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Firſt-born of that Nation were alſo a typical ſort of perſons: therefore <hi>Eſau</hi> in deſpiſing his Birthright deſpiſed a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Priviledge; and therefore juſtly called a profane perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16.</p>
               <p>And they alſo typified Chriſt and the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt:</hi> For he is <hi>the Firſt-born among many Brethren,</hi> Rom. 8.29.</p>
               <p>The Church: And thence the ſame Name and Title is given to all the Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. <hi>The general Aſſembly and Church of the Firſt-born.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Analogy appears chiefly in two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In regard of the Lords ſpecial Intereſt and Propriety in them.</item>
                  <item>2. In regard of their Preheminence and Dignity above others.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The Lords Propriety in them as his in a ſpecial and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner; <hi>The Firſt-born are mine.</hi> Becauſe he had redeemed them, when the Firſt-born of <hi>Egypt</hi> were deſtroyed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.2.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt hath a ſpecial relation to God, as his firſt begotten,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96313:80"/>
yea his only begotten Son; his Son by Nature, (we are Sons on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Adoption and Grace) <hi>Primogenitus ante quem nullus, &amp; uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitus poſt quem nullus</hi>— Joh. 1.14.</p>
               <p>So the Saints: The Lord hath a ſpecial relation and propriety in them, all manner of ways; by Creation, by Redemption, by Regeneration, by his own choice of them, by their conſent and choice of him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of their Dignity and Preheminence above others: The <hi>Firſt-born</hi> had many Priviledges above his Brethren; he was, as it were the ſecond Father of the Family:</p>
               <p>So <hi>Chriſt, Iſai.</hi> 9.6. is called <hi>the everlaſting Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had the Honour, and the Government; the Prieſthood was his, and a double portion of the Eſtate, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.17.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt-born</hi> at firſt had the Prieſthood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.5. <hi>Young men ſacrificed</hi>— Afterward <hi>Levi</hi> was ſet apart inſtead of the <hi>Firſt-born, Numb.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Reuben</hi> left the Government to <hi>Judah,</hi> the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to <hi>Levi,</hi> the double Portion to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was divided into two Tribes <hi>Ephrahim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Chriſt has the Honour above all Creatures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>the Saints</hi> which are <hi>the Lords Firſt-born</hi> in a ſecondary way, are honourable perſons, as being Members of Chriſt: they are <hi>precious in his ſight and honourable:</hi> therefore he ſays, <hi>I will give Nations and Princes for thy Life,</hi> Iſai. 43.3, 4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their <hi>Nazarites;</hi> the Inſtitution of their religious Order, with all the Rules and Obſervations belonging to it, you have in the 6th chapter of <hi>Numbers.</hi> It was an Order of much eſteem amongſt the People of God in thoſe times, and is reckoned as a great Honour and Glory to that People, <hi>Amos</hi> 2.11. I raiſed of your Sons for Prophets, and of your Young men for <hi>Nazarites. Her</hi> Nazarites, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.7. <hi>were whiter than Snow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were two degrees of it; either for a certain time, or during a mans whole life.</p>
               <p>Of Perſons that were <hi>Nazarites</hi> all their days, the Scripture giveth ſome very great and eminent inſtances; as <hi>Sampſon,

               <p>Of Perſons under the Vow of Nazariteſhip only for ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, we have inſtance in <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.18. and again <hi>Acts</hi> 21.23, 24.</p>
               <p>How long they were to be under the Vow, the Scripture limits not. The Jewiſh Writers report, that one month was the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt time in uſe amongſt them.</p>
               <p>This Order ſhadowed forth ſundry things relating,
<list>
                     <item>1. To Chriſt himſelf.</item>
                     <item>2. To the Members of Chriſt.</item>

               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Nazarites</hi> were <hi>Types of Chriſt</hi> himſelf; not that Chriſt himſelf was a <hi>Nazarite</hi> according to the Law, but only in the Spirit and Truth of this Type.</p>
               <p>That he was not a <hi>Nazarite</hi> literally, is clear; becauſe he drank Wine, as at other times, ſo at his laſt Supper, which they might not do.</p>
               <p>But in him this Type was fulfilled in two reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of his uſual Name and Title, <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> or Jeſus the Nazarite, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. <hi>ult. Joh.</hi> 19.19.</p>
               <p>Thus he was uſually called, which the Jews would never have done; but that by the Providence of God he had lived in that place. In which diſpoſal of Providence, <hi>altius fuit Dei Conſilium;</hi> as <hi>Calvin in Mat.</hi> 2. God had a further Deſign and Counſel than they were aware of, that from thence called him by that Name: Which, though it was given him upon another occaſion by the <hi>Jews,</hi> namely, from the place of his Reſidence; yet God in his infinite Wiſdom did ſo contrive and order it, that by this means he ſhould be commonly called by the Name of this religious Order. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> where the Evangeliſt tells us, that by this means of Chriſts living in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> was fulfilled that which was ſpoken by the Prophets, namely, that <hi>he ſhould be called a Nazaren</hi>— By the Prophets is meant thoſe Prophets that wrote the Book of <hi>Judges;</hi> and the place intended, is <hi>Judges</hi> 13.5. as <hi>Calvin</hi> from <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> judgeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:96313:81"/>It is true indeed, the words there are ſpoken of <hi>Sampſon</hi> literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but intended myſtically of the Meſſiah, of whom both <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and all the <hi>Nazarites were Types.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, there is ſome literal difference between <hi>Zain</hi> and <hi>Tſade;</hi> and the <hi>Syriack</hi> Tranſlation (which yet is but a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) renders <hi>Nazareth</hi> by <hi>Tſade Notſoreth,</hi> whereas the word <hi>Nazarite</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> with <hi>Zain.</hi> But that the Holy Ghoſt regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a literal exactneſs is not probable.<note place="margin">See <hi>Buchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer Cbronol.</hi> p. 285.</note> It may ſuffice that there is an alluſion and affinity in the ſound. And though <hi>Matthew</hi> uſeth the word <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene,</hi> as ſignifying one of the religious Order of the <hi>Nazarites;</hi> yet <hi>Pilate, Joh.</hi> 19.19. uſeth the ſame word of him, never dreaming of any thing more, than the place where Chriſt had dwelt. Some indeed have thought that this paſſage in <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.23. refers to <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.1. where Chriſt is called <hi>Netſor, the Branch,</hi> a flouriſhing Branch. But we do not find that flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Branches are called <hi>Nazarites</hi> in the Scripture: ſo <hi>Calvin</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of his peculiar Holineſs and Separation unto God, They were ceremonially holy; but he was holy indeed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an higher and infinitely more excellent and glorious manner. He is called <hi>that holy thing that ſhall be born of thee,</hi> Luk. 1.35. and <hi>Dan</hi> 9.24. <hi>the moſt holy,</hi> or the Holy of holies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Nazarites</hi> were Types of all the Saints and Members of Chriſt. All Believers, who are an holy people, are ſpiritual <hi>Nazarites</hi> ſeparated unto God; I ſay, all Believers whether male or female. For there were Women Nazarites as well as Men, <hi>Num.</hi> 6.2. <hi>when either Man or Woman ſhall ſeparate themſelves to vow a Vow of a Nazarite. For in Chriſt Jeſus there is neither male nor fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,</hi> Gal. 3.28.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There was in this Order a Ceremonial ſhadow and adum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Benefits of Chriſt which Believers do receive from him; and they are chiefly two; Sanctification and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sanctification. This was ſhadowed out in this, that the <hi>Nazarites</hi> were perſons ſeparated and devoted unto God in a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:96313:82"/>
ſpecial manner by a Vow, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.6. As alſo in the particular Rules and Ceremonies belonging to this Order, which were three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not to drink Wine, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.3, 4. So <hi>Sampſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was to teach them Temperance and Mortification of fleſhly Luſts, which Wine often provokes men to, and <hi>takes away their hearts from that which is good,</hi> Hoſ. 4.11. <hi>and cauſes them to err and ſtumble,</hi> Iſai. 28.7.</p>
               <p>Moreover this Ceremony taught them, inſtead of Wine, <hi>to be filled with the Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 5.18. and inebriated as it were with the Joys thereof in the ſenſe of Gods Love, which is better than Wine, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not to cut their Hair, <hi>ver.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>This is thought to be appointed (as many other ceremonial Laws were) in oppoſition to the heatheniſh Idolatry of thoſe times; and to ſignifie the keeping himſelf from all uncleanneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity. For when the <hi>Nazarite</hi> was purged and cleanſed from impurity, his Hair was ſhaved off, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. and ſo the Leper, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14.8, 9. therefore to keep it from ſhaving ſeemeth to ſignifie the keeping themſelves from uncleanneſs: ſo ſome expound it.</p>
               <p>It ſhadowed forth alſo the growth of the Graces of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in them, as in <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who with the loſs of his Hair, loſt the Power of God: and <hi>as his Hair grew again, ſo his Strength in God renewed,</hi> Judg. 13 25— and 16. This Strength came not by the growth of the Hair, otherwiſe than as an outward Sign appointed unto them of God, who ſanctifieth to his people what outward Signs himſelf pleaſeth, to ſignifie and convey Grace; as he ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> to waſh away <hi>Naamans</hi> Leproſie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ainſworth</hi> on <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.5.</note> which of themſelves had no ſuch efficacy, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not to defile themſelves by the dead, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>This refraining from the dead, in whom the Image as it were of Gods Curſe for Sin was to be ſeen. For <hi>the Wages of Sin is Death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ainſworth in loc.</note> Rom. 6.23. figured out abſtaining from ſinful and dead Works, and from ſuch as live in them, who are dead whilſt they live, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6.</p>
               <p>It ſhewed their Conſtancy in the Rules of their Profeſſion,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:96313:82"/>
and their Magnanimity in the loſs of deareſt Comforts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Juſtification by Chriſt alone was ſhadowed forth in two Rules or Obſervations belonging to this Order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That legal ſtrictneſs and ſeverity of Purification in caſe of accidental Defilement, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10, 11, 12. If a <hi>Nazarite</hi> chance to be defiled, he is to begin again upon a new ſcore. This ſhews the abſolute Purity and Perfection of the Law of God, which will not admit the leaſt error or failing; but <hi>whoſoever continueth not in all things, is curſed and condemned by it,</hi> Deut. 27.26. Gal. 3.10. <hi>If a man keep the whole Law, and fail but in one point, he is guilty of all,</hi> James 2.10. and ſo needs Chriſt and his Blood to make atonement even for the leaſt Sins, and thoſe which are in ſome ſort involuntary, as the original corruption of Nature is, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny actual Sins of meer infirmity and frailty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sacrifices of Atonement, even when they had fulfilled their Vow, <hi>ver.</hi> 13— to 21.</p>
               <p>It taught the ſecret and unſeen Guiltineſs, which cleaveth to the moſt holy men in their beſt and moſt perfect works, which, without atonement by the Blood of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ainſworth in loc.</note> cannot be pure and pleaſing in the ſight of God. For though a man know nothing by himſelf; yet is he not thereby juſtified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4.</p>
               <p>When we have kept our Vows, and done our Duty; yet we need Atonement and Pardon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth religious Order amongſt them of old, was their <hi>Prophets.</hi> Theſe alſo were Types of Chriſt and Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Of Chriſt; For as they taught the will of God: ſo doth Chriſt. For <hi>he is the great Prophet,</hi> Deut 18.15. Acts 3.22. Joh. 1.18. <hi>no man knows the Father, but he to whom the Son revealeth him,</hi> Matth 11.27.</p>
               <p>But though there be a reſemblance and analogy; yet there is alſo a great diſparity in this <hi>Type.</hi> For all the <hi>Types</hi> (as hath been often obſerved) fell ſhort of the <hi>Antitype</hi> in Glory; and ſo in this; for <hi>none teacheth like him,</hi> Job 36.22. in regard of the Authority and Efficacy of his teaching.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Authority; For the Prophets ſpeak in the Lords
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96313:83"/>
Name; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord:</hi> but <hi>Chriſt in his own Name, and the Fathers; as a Son over his own Houſe,</hi> Heb. 3.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Efficacy. All the Prophets could not reach the Heart: but Chriſt, he teacheth inwardly, and effectually: for he ſends <hi>his Spirit to bring the Truths to remembrance</hi> with power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26.</p>
               <p>And as their <hi>Prophets</hi> were Types of Chriſt: ſo likewiſe of all Believers; for they are <hi>ſpiritually Prophets,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.27. 1 Cor. 2.15. <hi>the ſpiritual man judgeth all things.</hi> They are ſaid to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie as the Lords Witneſſes.</hi> Rev. 11.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A fifth <hi>religious Order</hi> in thoſe legal times was that of <hi>Prieſthood.</hi> Their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and eſpecially their High Prieſts were Types of Chriſt and Chriſtians: Therefore Chriſt is ſo often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a Prieſt, and the High Prieſt,</hi> Heb. 3.1. <hi>of our Profeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Analogy between Chriſt and them appears chiefly in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That as they offered Sacrifice, and by Sacrifice made atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. gave himſelf for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling favour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was in them the ſhadow (though but the ſhadow) of an <hi>everlaſting Prieſthood;</hi> becauſe the Office was ſettled in the Houſe and Family of <hi>Aaron:</hi> and ſo though the perſons died; yet the Office was never vacant: for the Son ſucceeded the Father, and was ſometimes inveſted during the Fathers life, as <hi>Eleazer, Numb.</hi> 20.26.</p>
               <p>And though <hi>Melchizedeks Prieſthood</hi> was of an higher Order, and more illuſtrious than that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. yet in this alſo there was but a ſhadow of Eternity, as hath been formerly ſhewed.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Chriſt is indeed a Prieſt for ever:</hi> he is often ſo called in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews. He was made a Prieſt not after the Law of a carnal Commandment, but after the Power of everlaſting life, Heb.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>The Diſparity between Chriſt and theſe <hi>typical Prieſts</hi> was manifold. I ſhall inſtance in a few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theirs was but the ſhadow: Chriſt the true Sacrifice, and true Reconciliation with God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:96313:83"/>2. They offered Sacrifice firſt for their own Sins: but Chriſt had no Sins of his own, to offer for, and to make ſatisfaction for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All thoſe Prieſts of old, even <hi>Melchizedek</hi> himſelf, they were <hi>but Prieſts;</hi> they were not both Prieſt, Altar and Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt is all three.</p>
               <p>He is Prieſt as God-man.</p>
               <p>He is the Altar in regard of his Divine nature: for this is that that ſanctifies the Gift, and makes the Sacrifice ſo infinitely effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious and meritorious.</p>
               <p>And Chriſt himſelf is alſo the Sacrifice in regard of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature: His Humane nature ſuffered death, and ſo was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up as a Sacrifice unto God for us.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>in all things Chriſt hath the Preheminence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might alſo ſhew, how all the Saints are Prieſts. <hi>He hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto our God,</hi> Revel. 1.</p>
               <p>But there will be occaſion to ſpeak further of the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> when we come to the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the <hi>Temple Miniſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. A ſixth religious Order was their <hi>Kings of the Houſe of David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, Magiſtracy is a civil Ordinance belonging to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table: But yet, as God was pleaſed to annex a typical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto the Sabbath, which is in it ſelf a moral Duty: and unto <hi>Adams</hi> Marriage with <hi>Eve,</hi> which was a civil Relation: ſo he did unto Magiſtracy or Kingſhip, as ſtated and ſettled amongſt that people.</p>
               <p>Hence as in the buſineſs of Marriage, and of the Sabbath, the things themſelves are not aboliſhed, but only the typical reſpects are taken off: ſo here Kingſhip as amongſt them was both a civil and a religious Order. <hi>Non dubium eſt, quin caeleſtis pater in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ejuſque poſteris conſpici voluerit vivam Chriſti Imaginem, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin.

               <p n="1">1. In their Inauguration; they were anointed with holy Oil, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.20. <hi>with mine holy Oil have I anointed him.</hi> This typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit; the Spirit of Government,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96313:84"/>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 10.38. <hi>how God anointed Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt, which Chriſt received above his Fellows.</hi> Pſal. 45.7. not by meaſure, but <hi>above meaſure,</hi> Joh. 3.34.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord ſettled the Kingdom by an everlaſting Covenant in a perpetual Series and Succeſſion of perſons in the Houſe of <hi>David:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he hath made an everlaſting Covenant, that <hi>his Kingdom ſhall endure for ever,</hi> Iſai. 9.7— <hi>of the increaſe of his Government and Peace, there ſhall be no end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The moral work and duty of their Office had alſo a typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal uſe, to ſhadow forth what Chriſt doth ſpiritually in and for his Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They made Laws for the people of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> though they did it ſtill in ſubordination to, and purſuance of the Laws of God, as all Magiſtrates ought to do, not in oppoſition to them:</p>
               <p>So Chriſt is the Law-giver of his Church, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33.22. <hi>the Lord is our Judge, our King, our Law-giver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They ſubdued the Enemies of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> ſo did <hi>David</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> the <hi>Moabites, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So doth Chriſt ſubdue and tread down the Churches Enemies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was their work to execute Vengeance upon Rebels; as <hi>Solomon,</hi> the peaceful King, did on <hi>Joab, Adonijah, Shimei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So doth Chriſt, the Prince of Peace, on Unbelievers and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites in the Church. This King will ſay, <hi>Bring forth theſe mine Enemies, and ſlay them before my face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet there was a great Diſparity between Chriſt and thoſe Kings. His Kingdom is ſpiritual, his Government infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than theirs was, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.4, 5. ſome underſtand and render to this purpoſe,<note place="margin">See ths Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> 
                  <hi>There ſhall be a Ruler o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men, a righteous one, ruling in the Fear of God— Although as yet he make him not to ſpring up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the whole,</p>
               <p>

               <p>It falls heavy upon the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who have their religious (as they call them, but indeed ſuperſtitious) Orders. Their <hi>Monks,

               <p>But this was a Type: and therefore to revive it, is inconſiſtent with the truth of the Goſpel; it is as if they ſhould ſay, there is a Meſſiah yet to come, who will be juſt like <hi>a Monk or a Friar;</hi> but what horrible Blaſphemy is this!</p>
               <p>Beſides there was a Command, an Inſtitution from God for the Order of <hi>Nazarites;</hi> but there is not ſo for <hi>Popiſh Orders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, which is obſervable in all the Rules and Ceremonies, and Burdens of thoſe legal times, the Lord never reſtrained Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage from any; but all ſorts, Prieſts, Prophets, Nazarites were wont to marry, which the Popiſh Orders vow againſt, which the Apoſtle deſervedly calls <hi>a Doctrine of Devils,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.1, 2, 3.</p>

We are now to proceed (the Lord aſſiſting) to the <hi>real Types;</hi> and theſe may be ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two ſorts, <hi>occaſional</hi> and <hi>perpetual;</hi> for ſome Types were tranſient, and ſome permanent: Some were <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>occaſional;</hi> as <hi>Manna,</hi> and the <hi>Brazen Serpent, &amp;c.</hi> ſome were <hi>perpetual, viz.</hi> the whole <hi>ceremonial Law,</hi> the Ordinances whereof are frequently called <hi>everlaſting Statutes:</hi> ſo that this Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is founded both in the nature of the things, and in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture

expreſſions about it. We ſhall clear it further, when we come to the ſecond part of the Diſtribution.</p>
               <p>Concerning the former ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> extraordinary and <hi>occaſional Types,</hi> this Text ſpeaks, and gives you this Doctrine;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there were divers extraordinary Providences of God towards his people of old, which were intended by him to be Types of Goſpel-myſteries, and Inſtructions to us in Goſpel-times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Text is plain, and the word in the original is <hi>Types,</hi> as your Margent reads; <hi>Now all theſe things happened unto them for Types,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and he had before mentioned <hi>the Cloud, and the Rock that followed them, their paſſing through the red Sea;</hi> with other famous Diſpenſations towards Gods people of old. There were not only <hi>typical perſons,</hi> but <hi>typical Providences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the right underſtanding of this Doctrine, to prevent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes; take theſe two Propoſitions by way of Caution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caut.</hi> 1. That there is an hiſtorical Verity in all thoſe typical Hiſtories of the Old Teſtament. They are not bare Allegories, or parabolical Poems, ſuch as is the Song of <hi>Solomon,</hi> or <hi>Jothams</hi> Parable, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.7. or <hi>Nathans</hi> Parable to <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. but they are a true Narration of things really exiſtent and acted in the world, and are literally and hiſtorically to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, that in ſome of thoſe tranſactions, as for inſtance, <hi>their Deliverance out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and travelling through the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to</hi> Canaan, the whole frame of the Hiſtory all along is ſo ſuitable to expreſs ſpiritual Redemption, as one would think it was an Allegory deviſed on purpoſe for that end.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer is, that God had the ordering of his World in his own hands; and therefore could make it ſuit all his ends at once, ſo as the ſame thing might be both an Hiſtory of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Redemption; and yet withal and Allegory of ſpiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption alſo.</p>
               <p>Neither indeed is it neceſſary to the nature of an Allegory that it be always <hi>Res ſicta:</hi> God, who is the Author of all the Arts (for all the true Rules of them are Beams and Rays of his glorious Wiſdom) he hath ſet no ſuch Rule in the Art of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96313:86"/>
if any <hi>Rhetoricians</hi> have done it, it is a miſtake: For <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael is a real Hiſtory;</hi> yet the Apoſtle affirmeth that <hi>it is an Allegory,</hi> Gal. 4. The turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all ſuch allegorical and typical Hiſtories and Providences into meer Romances and Fictions, is not unlike the Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation of the Sacramental Elements; as if things could not be real and yet typical too. You will find many Treaſures of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom and Goſpel-light in the Scriptures, by attending this Rule of underſtanding, and of accommodating typical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures both to <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Antitype,</hi> not excluding either, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing really meant of both, and moſt fully of Chriſt the <hi>Antitype,</hi> who is the ſcope and centre of all the Counſels and Diſpoſitions of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caut.</hi> 2. That the Lord in theſe occaſional and extraordinary Diſpenſations whereof we ſpeak, did aim at ſundry ends, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them to be for ſeveral uſes, namely, to be not only Types, but other ways alſo to be inſtructive and uſeful: and herein his infinite Wiſdom appears the more, in cauſing ſo many ends to meet at once: and indeed ſo it is in all the reſt of his Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards his people, and in the world: and ſo in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances we have at this day, they do not ſerve for one uſe only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what are theſe ends?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not to inſiſt upon the general Ends of all the <hi>Types;</hi> in this ſort we are now upon, <hi>viz. tranſient and occaſional Types,</hi> there were three great Ends.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For their outward and temporal good; they had by theſe things outward ſupply and deliverance: ſo the paſſing through the red Sea, the Manna, the Water out of the Rock were outward Mercies: ſo the Brazen Serpent gave outward and bodily Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, beſide that ſpiritual and ſacramental uſe it had to adumbrate Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They were Inſtructions in moral Duties, as indeed all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences are: the Lords giving them Water out of the Rock, and Bread from Heaven, were inſtructing Providences to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in ſtraits, and to truſt in him at all times.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third End was the typical Adumbration of Chriſt and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:96313:87"/>
Goſpel-myſteries, beſides all other ends and uſes of them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides outward and temporal good and moral Inſtruction; they did, by the poſitive Intention of the Spirit of God, point at Chriſt, and lead to him. For this the Text is expreſs, <hi>all theſe things happened unto them in Types,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>that Rock was Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How may we judge what providential Diſpenſations had ſuch a typical reſpect and uſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This hath been formerly partly ſpoken to, and this Rule was given, that it is not ſafe for men to form Allegories out of their own Fancies, unleſs it be ſome way hinted in the Scripture, unleſs it be either expreſſed, or may be gathered from thence by clear conſequence; as when by comparing the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, a manifeſt analogy doth appear as clear as the Sun at noon day. But for men to ſet their Fancies a work to extract Allegories out of every Scripture hiſtory, as the Popiſh Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters uſe to do, is not ſafe nor becoming a judicious Interpreter.</p>

               <p>We are to ſpeak to theſe occaſional typical things, ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were given to particular perſons, as that viſional Ladder to <hi>Jacob;</hi> the burning Buſh was ſhewed to <hi>Moſes</hi>— others of them were given to the whole people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the Pillar of Cloud and Fire, and all the reſt that were enumerated.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Jacobs Ladder,</hi> which he ſaw at <hi>Bethel.</hi> This was but an <hi>occaſional Type,</hi> it was no permanent thing. The Hiſtory of it is in <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.12-16.</p>
               <p>That it had a typical reſpect, our Saviour himſelf ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It repreſented Chriſt as the means of Intercourſe between God and Man.</p>
               <p>Yet it was not to ſpeak properly <hi>a Type,</hi> but rather <hi>a typical Viſion,</hi> being not a thing actually exiſtent, but only in <hi>a Viſion</hi> of the night: however becauſe divers that have ſpoke upon <hi>the Types</hi> have made mention of it, I ſhall alſo ſpeak a word to it.</p>
               <p>Yet even this circumſtance ſome have thought of a typical accommodation for it thus. That as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw this <hi>Ladder</hi> but in <hi>a Viſion:</hi> ſo we ſee Chriſt here but <hi>in a Glaſs darkly,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. till the day-light of Glory in Heaven dawn upon us; but then face to face.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall draw the Parallel only in theſe five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here was ſome dark ſhadow of the Perſon, Natures and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96313:88"/>
of Chriſt, thus; In that this <hi>Ladder</hi> the foot of it ſtood upon the Earth, and the top of it reached up to Heaven, whereby Heaven and Earth did meet as it were:</p>
               <p>So Chriſt in regard of his human Nature toucheth the Earth; yet in regard of his Deity, he is the God of Heaven.</p>
               <p>And as in this <hi>Ladder,</hi> the top and the foot of it made but <hi>one Ladder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So both the Natures of Chriſt are but one Perſon; and by this Union of his two Natures he brings Heaven and Earth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unites God and Man, which was the great work for which he came into the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>viſional Ladder</hi> ſhews the way to Heaven.</p>
               <p>There is no aſcending to Heaven, but by the ſpiritual Ladder Jeſus Chriſt, no Salvation but by Chriſt, no comfortable Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and Communion between God and us, but only in and through him.</p>
               <p>Men cannot climb to Heaven by their own Works and Merits: though they ſhould heap Mountain to Mountain of Duties one upon another; yet they would fall ſhort. Neither is there Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in any other; for <hi>there is no other Name under Heaven given amongst men whereby we muſt be ſaved,</hi> Acts 4.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have in this <hi>typical Ladder</hi> an expreſs Figure of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Angels through Jeſus Chriſt unto the Saints, which is a Fruit of that great priviledge of Adoption: For they aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſcended in the Viſion by this Ladder.</p>
               <p>To wicked men the Angels are Enemies (as if the King frown upon a man, all the Court does ſo too) and fight againſt them, as they did againſt <hi>Senacheribs</hi> Army, when <hi>they ſlew an hundred eighty five thouſand in one night,</hi> 2 King. 19.35 — ſo Pſal. 35.5, 6. <hi>Let them be as Chaff before the Wind, and let the Angel of the Lord chaſe them; let their way be dark and ſlippery, and let the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord perſecute them.</hi> The bleſſed Angels are ever cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and perſecuting Reprobates and wicked men.</p>
               <p>But through Chriſt they miniſter unto us for our good, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.9. <hi>they appeared behind him,</hi> and ver. 10. <hi>theſe are they whom the Lord hath ſent forth,</hi> and ver. 11. <hi>they give up their account t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:96313:88"/>4. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſees God at the top of the <hi>Ladder,</hi> renewing his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>So it is through Chriſt that God enters into Covenant and renews his Covenant with us; through Chriſt the Promiſes are <hi>Yea and Amen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 20. God could never have ſpoken words of peace to Sinners, but by the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Where was this Ladder ſeen? At <hi>Bethel,</hi> which ſignifies the Houſe of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>he called the name of the place Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Chriſt is ſeen in the Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.10. <hi>and through the Church made known to Principalities and Powers, &amp;c.</hi> If you would have a Viſion of Chriſt, go to <hi>Bethel,</hi> into the Churches of his Saints and People, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.8. <hi>if thou know not, go thy way forth by the footſteps of the Flock.</hi> There be ſeveral ſteps of this Ladder; ſome apply it thus, Several degrees of Grace; as many Rounds of the Ladder, ſo many Graces: The loweſt Round is poverty of Spirit, the higheſt is Perfection.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how <hi>Jacobs Ladder</hi> repreſented and ſhadowed forth ſomething of Chriſt, and of the Goſpel, to him and us; and ſo much for this <hi>ſpiritual Ladder</hi> which <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond <hi>typical thing</hi> in thoſe typical days was <hi>the burning Buſh</hi> which the Lord ſhewed to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 3. in the ten firſt verſes: a very memorable Diſpenſation; therefore largely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 7, 30. to 35.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Buſh</hi> burnt, and was not conſumed.</p>
               <p>A moſt lively Emblem of the Churches ſubſiſting in the Fire of Perſecution through the preſence and good will of him that dwelt in the <hi>burning Buſh.</hi> That is the Inſtruction we ſhould learn out of it. As <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Iron Furnace in <hi>Egypt:</hi> for it related both ways, both to ſhew the ſtate of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and of the Church of God on earth afterwards.</p>
               <p>So the three Children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. in the fiery Furnace were not conſumed, no nor hurt by the Fire.</p>
               <p>So in the times of Antichriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3: the Lord hath his Witneſſes propheſying all the thouſand two hundred and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore days: God hath his two Witneſſes all the while, though
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:96313:89"/>
they propheſie in Sackcloth; yet propheſie they do, and bear witneſs to him: The Lord doth not leave himſelf without Witneſs when his Church and Intereſt is in the loweſt and moſt aflicted condition: and indeed all along under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this Buſh hath been burning <hi>in ſeveral Fires,</hi> and yet not conſumed.</p>
               <p>There was firſt <hi>the fire of Pagan Perſecution</hi> during the three firſt Centuries.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>the fire of Arrianiſm, and Contention in the Church, &amp;c.</hi> ſet forth under that prophetical repreſentation of Fire in the firſt and ſecond Trumpets, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.7, 8.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>the fire of Antichriſtian Perſecution a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then laſtly <hi>the Perſecution of three days and an half</hi> in the laſt part of his Reign.</p>
               <p>But yet ſtill <hi>the burning Buſh</hi> is not conſumed: the Church of God ſubſiſts, and lives, and outlives all oppoſition, it cannot, it ſhall not be conſumed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They have power over the Fire,</hi> Rev. 14.18. It is underſtood by ſome Interpreters not unfitly concerning the <hi>Martyrs</hi> that ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Fire, but were not overcome by it; their Faith and Patience was not overcome, but did triumph and conquer through Jeſus Chriſt: and all this through the Preſence of God with them. For <hi>he that dwelt in the burning Buſh, dwells in the midſt of his Church,</hi> Deut. 33.16. Acts 7.35. <hi>The Son of God was in the Furnace.</hi> Dan. 3.25. And under the New Teſtament <hi>he walketh in the midſt of the ſeven Golden Candleſticks,</hi> Rev. 2.1 — He hath promiſed, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.2. <hi>when thou walkeſt through the Fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the Flame kindle upon thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two <hi>typical things</hi> were preſented to particular perſons, namely, the <hi>myſtical Ladder</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the <hi>burning Buſh</hi> to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other <hi>five</hi> were more publick to the <hi>whole people</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> namely, the Pillar of Cloud and Fire, the Manna, the Rock and Water out of it, the Brazen Serpent, and the Pool of <hi>Betheſda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Pillar of Cloud and Fire,</hi> Exod. 13.21, 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:96313:89"/>As to the nature of it, it ſeems to have been not unlike thoſe things which are called in Scripture <hi>Pillars of Smoke,</hi> Joel 2.30. which the Apoſtle renders <hi>Vapour of Smoke,</hi> Acts 2.19. which the Lord did now create, and in a miraculous way, and by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of his Angels, who are the Inſtruments of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Miniſters to his Church; did carry it, and move it to and fro from place to place.</p>
               <p>It is called <hi>a Cloud,</hi> becauſe it had ſomething of that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but it was not an ordinary and natural, but a ſupernatural and miraculous Cloud; and differed from other ordinary Clouds in many reſpects.</p>
               <p>It was of ſuch an height and bigneſs as was and might be ſeen by all the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael, Exod. ult. ult.</hi> other Clouds are ſoon diſperſed and diſſipated: But this remained firm for the ſpace of forty years together, till they came into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> the lower part of it reſted upon the Tabernacle, after that the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle was erected, and from thence it aſcended and went up like a Pillar of Smoke, as we read of <hi>Pillars of Smoke, Judg.</hi> 20.40. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.6. it was one and the ſame ſubſtance, which was <hi>a Cloud by day, and Fire by night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was not real natural Fire; therefore called <hi>the appearance of Fire,</hi> Numb. 9.16. It was not <hi>Ignis urens,</hi> but only <hi>Ignis lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens;</hi> it was no burning, but only ſhining Fire: For it ſate upon the Tabernacle, which was made of boards and other combuſtible matter. It kept its form, and was not moved by the Wind or by any other ordinary and common Cauſe, but by the Lord himſelf: and it moved and walked no faſter than the whole Camp could follow.</p>
               <p>Out of <hi>this Cloud</hi> the Lord ſpake and delivered his Oracles to <hi>Moſes. And there the Glory of the Lord appeared to the people, Exod.</hi> 16.10. and 33.9. and 34.5. <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.7. <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.25. and 12.5. Deut. 31.15.</p>
               <p>Thus for the Hiſtory of it.</p>
               <p>Now that there was a Myſtery in this <hi>Pillar of Cloud and Fire,</hi> is clear from <hi>Iſai.</hi> 4.5, 6. for there never was a literal Cloud and Fire upon <hi>Mount Sion.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Chriſt himſelf; ſome have noted a ſhadow both of his Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Humanity. There was a fiery Brightneſs in the Cloud, which yet was but a dark ſhadow of the Glory of his Deity, which was often in Viſions ſo repreſented: But his divine Nature was veiled and overclouded by his humane; as in this ſhadow there was <hi>a Pillar of Cloud</hi> as well as <hi>Fire.</hi> In <hi>Revel.</hi> 10.1. Chriſt is repreſented as <hi>clothed with a Cloud, and his Feet as Pillars of Fire.</hi> Expreſſions notably anſwering this antient Type and Shadow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It holds forth ſomething of the Benefits of Chriſt. What Benefits had they from this <hi>Pillar of Fire and Cloud?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had three.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Light and Direction.</item>
                  <item>2. Defence and Protection.</item>
                  <item>3. Ornament and Glory. All which we have in an higher manner in Chriſt by the Goſpel.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Light and Direction in the way that they ſhould go in thoſe <hi>Arabian</hi> Deſarts, where no man dwelt, and which no man paſſed thorough; where there was neither Path nor Guide: But they had the Lord himſelf to guide them. So it is ſaid of this Cloud in <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.21. where it is firſt mentioned, that it was <hi>to lead them the way by day, and by night to give them Light;</hi> and more fully and with much emphaſis, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.17, 18. and to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>So doth Chriſt direct and conduct his people in their travels through the Wilderneſs of this world to Heaven, the true <hi>Canaan: He is the true Light,</hi> Joh. 1.9. <hi>who coming into the world, enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96313:90"/>
every one that is enlightned.</hi> For ſo that place may be fitly rendred, <hi>He is the way the truth and the life,</hi> Joh. 14.6.</p>
               <p>There is a directing Light: they are under the everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his Word and Spirit. He doth not leave his people in the dark, as to things abſolutely neceſſary for their Communion with him here in this world, and for their Salvation with him in the world to come: we muſt follow Chriſt as they followed the Cloud.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond Benefit they had by this Cloud was Safety and Protection, both from the heat and ſcorchings of the Sun in thoſe burning Sands and Deſarts of <hi>Arabia:</hi> For the Cloud covered and overſhadowed them; therefore it is ſaid of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.39. <hi>he ſpread the Cloud for a Covering:</hi> And likewiſe from their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Perſecutors and Enemies: For <hi>the Cloud went behind them</hi> when their Safety ſo required, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.19, 20. as if the Lord ſhould ſay, You ſhall not hurt them, till you have ſtricken thorough me firſt.</p>
               <p>Yea the very ſame Diſpenſations which are directing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting to his people, are dark and deſtructive to his Enemies: as here, the ſame Cloud was light to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but darkneſs to the <hi>Egyptians. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon all the Glory ſhall be a Defence and a Covert from the Storm,</hi> Iſai. 4.2 laſt. There is a protecting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God in his Church; we do experience the truth of this at this day in all our ſolemn Aſſemblies, there is a wonderful protecting Providence over us.</p>
               <p>Every Church of Saints is a ſpiritual Army of Jeſus Chriſt, and theſe Armies are terrible, <hi>Cantcles</hi> 6.10. <hi>glorious as the Sun, terrible as an Army with Banners.</hi> It is a terrible thing to offend or trouble them: a man had better fight againſt all the power the great <hi>Turk</hi> can raiſe, than oppoſe or offend one Church of Chriſt, and there were more hope of Succeſs. For <hi>the Lord himſelf is a Wall of Fire round about them,</hi> Zach. 2.5. as well as <hi>the Glory in the midſt of them.</hi> Therefore it is written, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.17. <hi>no Weapon that is formed againſt thee ſhall proſper, and every tongue that ſhall riſe againſt thee in judgment thou ſhalt condemn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some allude thus upon theſe two Benefits they had by the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:96313:91"/>
Cloud. That Truth is as a Pillar of Fire to go before us, and Peace as a Pillar of Cloud to overſhadow and refreſh us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This fiery Pillar was exceeding glorious, it was an honour and glory to them: ſo in the Church, Chriſt is the Glory of his Church. See <hi>Iſai.</hi> 4.2.</p>
               <p>We would think, if we could ſee a company of Kings and Princes, and Nobles and great men walking together in the Ways and Ordinances of Chriſt, this were glorious, but <hi>Deus maximus in minimis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a Glory in the meaneſt of the Aſſemblies of his Saints, though ſpiritual, that carnal eyes are not able to diſcern it. When you come to the meetings and Aſſemblies of Gods People, you ſhould endeavour to ſee this divine Glory: you ſhould by Faith diſcern and ſee a Pillar of Cloud and Fire over the places where they meet, and a Guard of Angels and fiery Chariots round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. God is preſent there, <hi>in his Temple doth every one ſpeak of his Glory,</hi> Pſal. 29.9.</p>
               <p>Thus the Pillar of Cloud and Fire did figure and exhibit to them the Benefits of Chriſt, Light and Direction, Safety and Protection, Ornament and Glory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It figured alſo the Ordinances of Chriſt, and his Preſence in and with them: For the Ordinances are the outward and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible tokens of Gods Preſence with his people; as this fiery Pillar was of old. And therefore when the Tabernacle was made and ſet up, <hi>it reſted upon the Tabernacle,</hi> Exod. 40.38.</p>
               <p>There be ſome Duties are ſecret, which the world ſees not, nor may ſee; as Alms-deeds, perſonal and ſecret Prayer.</p>
               <p>But the Ordinances of Inſtitution are things that ought to be practiſed with all the publickneſs that may be. They are outward and viſible tokens of Gods Preſence; particularly that great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Baptiſm, as in this Chapter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2.</p>
               <p>The Cloud, it ſeems, had a refreſhing moiſture in it, to ſhade and to refreſh and cool them from the burning heat: And they were bedewed with it, as we are with the Water of Baptiſm; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>this legal Cloud</hi> became <hi>a Type of Goſpel-Baptiſm.</hi> And ſo you ſee how it repreſented ſomething of Chriſt himſelf, and ſomething
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96313:91"/>
of his Benefits and ſomething of his Ordinances under the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>So much for this third typical thing, <hi>this Pillar of Cloud and Fire.</hi>

               <p>A Fourth typical thing amongſt them of old was their <hi>Manna or Bread from Heaven.</hi> And a fifth was <hi>the Rock that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, and gave them Water.</hi> Here was ſpiritual Meat and ſpiritual Drink. Of theſe two, the Lord aſſiſting at this time. They are both mentioned above in the 3, and 4th verſes of this Chapter; <hi>And they did all eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat, and did all drink the ſame ſpiritual Drink: For they drank of that ſpiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth, I ſay was the <hi>Manna,</hi> or the Bread that came from Heaven; the Hiſtory whereof we have in <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.14, 15. <hi>Behold upon the face of the Wilderneſs there lay a ſmall round thing, as ſmall as the hoar froſt, on the ground— And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto them, this is the Bread which the Lord hath given you to eat;</hi> which, that it was indeed a Type, and that the Truth and Myſtery of it was Chriſt himſelf, as the Bread of Life, and the Food of our Souls, Chriſt himſelf aſſures us in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.32. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you,</hi> Moſes <hi>gave you not that Bread from Heaven, but my Father giveth you the true Bread from Heaven.</hi> And ver. 48. <hi>I am that Bread of Life.</hi> And ver. 51. <hi>I am the living Bread which came down from Heaven:</hi> and ſo the Apoſtle a little before the Text inſtanceth in this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3. <hi>They did all eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat.</hi> This then was the general ſcope of it, to hold forth Chriſt as the Food of our Souls.</p>
               <p>But now to let you ſee a little more particularly the excellent Correſpondence between the <hi>Type</hi> and the <hi>Antitype,</hi> the clear and full Analogy that is between the Shadow and the Truth prefigured by it. You may diſcern it in theſe five particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This <hi>Manna</hi> was a Portion prepared of God, and given
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96313:92"/>
down from Heaven to an unworthy murmuring rebellious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple— <hi>When the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>firſt ſaw it, they ſaid one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is Manna<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they wiſt not what it was,</hi> Exod. 16.15. This word <hi>Manna</hi> your Margent tells you, it may be rendred <hi>what is this?</hi> or <hi>it is a Portion,</hi> a prepared or diſtributed Portion, from the Verb <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>praeparavit;</hi> becauſe God prepare and diſtribute it among them, and it was ready to their hand, to be eaten as they found it; though they might alſo bake it, if they would. The Hebrew word Manna is retained in the New Teſtament in the Greek, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.31. and from thence and in our own and other Languages there is another thing known by the ſame name, of which Writers ſay, that it is a Syriack Dew; but it will neither melt with the Sun, nor putrefie in the night; nor is it fit for Food, but for Phyſick only: ſo it differs wholly from this Hebrew Manna whereof we ſpeak, which God in a miraculous way did rain down from Heaven: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.23, 24. <hi>He commanded the Clouds from above, and opened the doors of Heaven, and rained down Manna upon them, and gave them of the Corn of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this without any care or pains, or Induſtry of theirs; a Food which they neither ſowed nor laboured for, but had it for the taking up.</p>
               <p>And this he did for an unworthy, murmuring, ſinful people, when they were in a moſt rebellious frame; when they were murmuring, and ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.3. <hi>Would to God we had died in the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>when we ſate by the Fleſh-pots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon the Lord promiſeth, ver. 4. <hi>I will rain Bread from Heaven for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So is Chriſt a Portion, and a Food prepared for every hungry Soul; and he came down from Heaven, and is ſent and given of God even to rebellious Sinners: <hi>He gave Gifts to men, even to the rebellious, Pſal.</hi> 68.18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Manna was outwardly and ſeemingly deſpicable and contemptible; yet indeed the choiceſt Food, and moſt excellent in all reſpects, both as to Colour and Figure, Taſte and Uſe.</p>
               <p>It was but a little thing in quantity, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:96313:92"/>It is called <hi>Angels Food,</hi> Pſalm 78.25. <hi>men did eat Angels Food.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Figure of it round, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.31. like Coriander Seed, which Philoſophers note to be of the beſt and moſt perfect Figure.</p>
               <p>The Colour white, <hi>ibid.</hi> and <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.7. like to the Colour of Bdellium.</p>
               <p>The Taſte ſweet, like freſh Oil, or Wafers baked with Honey, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.7.</p>
               <p>And it ſuſtained ſix hundred thouſand fighting men, beſides Women and Children.</p>
               <p>They might eat it either as they found it, or grind and bake it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.8.</p>
               <p>Yet the Murmurers loathed it, and grew weary of it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.6. they called it, <hi>this light Bread, Numb.</hi> 21.5. for which they were deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>In like manner Jeſus Chriſt, as to his outward appearance is deſpicable and contemptible, and deſpiſed by the world, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53— though in himſelf moſt precious and excellent, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>to you that believe he is precious.</hi> Chriſt in the Promiſes and Ordinances is precious to the ſpiritual Taſte, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. <hi>If ſo be you have taſted that the Lord is gratious— and ſweeter than the Honey or Honey-comb,</hi> Pſal. 119.103.</p>
               <p>Their grinding and baking it, ſome apply to the Sufferings of Chriſt, whereby he was prepared to be unto us the Bread of Life.</p>
               <p>And he fills and ſatisfies the deſires of all Believers, the whole <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>But as in other Types, there is not only a reſemblance in part, but withal a diſparity and pre-eminence of the <hi>Antitype</hi> above the <hi>Type:</hi> ſo in this Chriſt infinitely excels the literal <hi>Manna,</hi> as the ſubſtance doth the ſhadow: For that did but feed the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but Chriſt feeds the Soul; that preſerved only the natural Life of the Body, and that only for a time, but could not give Life; but Chriſt preſerves ſpiritual Life, yea gives ſpiritual and eternal Life to Souls that were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes: and as he gives it, ſo he maintains and preſerves it for ever. <hi>Your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

did eat Manna and are dead,</hi> Joh. 6.49. <hi>but he that eats this true Bread ſhall never die,</hi> ver. 51.58. ſo that in this (as in all things) Chriſt hath the pre-eminence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Something of Myſtery may be obſerved in the quantity they were to gather, an Homer full, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.22. now an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was about two Quarts, or as others expreſs it, three Pints and an half of our meaſure; God gave them a liberal Allowance.</p>
               <p>The Homer was the Veſſel which did contain, and wherein they were to put the Manna.</p>
               <p>The Veſſel that holds Chriſt is the Heart and Soul; and ſo to get the Veſſel full of <hi>Manna,</hi> is to get the Heart full of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he that gathered had none to ſpare,</hi> Exod. 16.18. for it ſeems their manner was, when they had gathered it, to diſtribute to every one the ſame proportion, quoted by the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.14, 15. to perſwade them to a liberal communication of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſupplies to one another.</p>
               <p>It might alſo figure that ſpiritual Equality that is among Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, all ſorts of Believers having an equal portion in Chriſt the true Manna, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28, 29. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. <hi>them that have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained like precious Faith with us.</hi> We are all one in Chriſt Jeſus as to relative priviledges— <hi>Juſtificatio non ſuſcipit magis &amp; minus.</hi> The <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> her ſelf, though ſhe be <hi>Sanctificatior,</hi> yet ſhe is not <hi>Juſtificatior quam altera.</hi> All Saints are equally juſtified: and having the ſame precious Faith, ſhall be all made partakers of the ſame <hi>common Salvation:</hi> every Believer is compleat in Chriſt, the weak as well as the ſtrong, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Where did they get this Manna? There were three things chiefly remarkable as to the place, which ſeem to have ſomething of Myſtery in them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was about the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and no where elſe to be found but there.</p>
               <p>So is Chriſt the Bread of Life to be had in the Church, but no where elſe: <hi>Extra Eccleſiam non eſt Salus. Where two or three are gathered in his name, there is Chriſt,</hi> Matth. 18.</p>
               <p>His Parents found him in the Temple, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>If you would gather Manna, go to the Camp of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> If
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96313:93"/>
you would get Chriſt, go to the Church, and ſeek him there.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was hidden in the Dew, lapt up (as it were) in two beds of Dew, the one above it, and the other under it. Exod. 16.14. <hi>When the Dew was gone up, the Manna appeared on the face of the Earth</hi>— Numb. 11.9. <hi>When the Dew fell upon the Camp in the night, the Manna fell upon it:</hi> So Chriſt is exhibited in the Word and Ordinances. Dew is often mentioned as an expreſſion of Gods favour. <hi>I will be as the dew unto Iſrael,</hi> Hoſ. 14.5. And the Word is compared to Dew, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.2. And it is a hidden word to ſome. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. Chriſt is therefore fitly called the hidden Manna. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. We ſhould labour to ſee Chriſt, to get Chriſt in the Word, Chriſt in an Ordinance; to gather Manna out of the Dew.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They went and were to go out of their Tents to gather it. <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.16. So we muſt go forth out of our ſelves out of Sin, and ſelf, and the Creature, to get Chriſt. He that ſtays within in his own Tent cannot gather Manna; yet it is but ſtepping out of doors. Oh the ſloth and negligence of ſuch as periſh for want of it! When Manna falls round about our Tents in the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel, wherein Chriſt is offered from day to day.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The time when they had this Manna. There were many Circumſtances in the time, that are very ſignificant and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were to gather it early in the morning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.12. The Quails came at Evening, for naturally they flew in the day time to the Sea, and came to Land towards night. <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.31. But Manna came in the Morning, becauſe it ſell with the Morning Dew.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſworth</hi> in Exod. 16.12.</note> And the Quails are not noted in the Scripture to be a ſpiritual meat, as the Manna is: we ſhould ſeek after Chriſt betimes, in the Morning of our Lives, with our firſt endeavours. Pſal. 90.14. <hi>Satisfie us in the Morning with thy loving kindneſs. They that ſeek me early, ſhall find me,</hi> Prov. 8— This ſhould be our firſt work, Mat. 6.33. <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God and the Righteouſneſs thereof, and then all other things ſhall be ſuperadded,</hi> and given (as it were) into the bargain.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:96313:94"/>2. They were to gather it and feed upon it daily, from day to day: if they kept it, it putrified and ſtank, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.19, 20. It wormed Worms, as the phraſe is in that emphatical Language, that is, it bred them abundantly, or crawled full of Worms.</p>
               <p>A miraculous Judgment for their Unbelief, and Curioſity, and Diſobedience; whereby they were taught to depend upon a daily Providence for daily Bread, as we pray in the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread</hi>— we ſhould be content with the preſent Supplies that Providence caſts in, without inordinate cares and thoughts for to morrow: <hi>Let your converſation be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Covetouſneſs, and to be content with ſuch things as you have,</hi> Heb. 13.5. <hi>Take no thought for to morrow,</hi> Matth. 6.31, 34.</p>
               <p>This paſſage may have a further reference, and be applied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, the Myſtery of this Type, thus; that as Manna muſt be daily gathered, daily fed upon: ſo muſt Chriſt; we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, and believe and feed upon him every day: or elſe the ſweeteſt Manna will become as rottenneſs, and a favour of Death unto Death unto carnal and formal Profeſſors, who ſuffer Manna to lie by them un-eaten, who ſuffer Chriſt to lie by them un-imployed and un-improved for ſpiritual ſupplies: we muſt feed upon Chriſt, and receive freſh ſupplies from Chriſt every day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They were to gather a double portion upon the ſixth day, and none upon the Sabbath, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.23—to 27. By this the Lord taught them to reſt upon the Sabbath. This is the ſecond place where the Sabbath is expreſly mentioned before the giving of the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> The firſt mention of it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fall of Man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.1, 2. which ſhews the Antiquity of the Sabbath: For that was two thouſand five hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years before this; which would be a very vaſt and ſtrange Prolepſis, if it were ſo as the Anti-Sabbatarians weakly and fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretend. And here now we have a ſecond mention of the Sabbath before that upon Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> And it doth not ſeem by any circumſtance of the Hiſtory, to be here mentioned as a new thing unto them; but rather as a Duty they formerly knew; but the Obſervance of it now, anew recommended to them by a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpecial Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:96313:94"/>Moreover, they might here learn, That God diſpenſeth Chriſt, the true Manna, to Believers moſt plentifully towards their later end; as he did to <hi>Simeon</hi> in his old age, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. Chriſtians when they grow near the Grave, and near to their eternal Reſt, they ſhould gather double Manna.</p>
               <p>Yet further we may here learn and ſee, That after this Life all endeavours are in vain: If you have not gotten Chriſt before, there is no Manna to be rained down then. There be no offers of Grace, nor means of Grace; then you muſt pray no more, hear Sermons no more; but an end then of all your former op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities. They went out to gather, but they found none, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. So the fooliſh Virgins asked the wiſe for Oil, but it was too late: their time was paſt. It is the caſe of many a Soul.</p>
               <p>The weekly Sabbath now is a day of ſpiritual gathering, and getting Food for your Souls: But there will a Sabbath come, a time and ſtate of Reſt, when you muſt live upon the Manna you have got and gathered in this Life, or elſe you periſh.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It ceaſed when they came to <hi>Canaan:</hi> they had it till then, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.35. but then they did eat of the Fruit of the Land of <hi>Canaan, Joſh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>The Manna ceaſed on the morrow after they had eaten of the old Corn of the Land:</hi> So ſhall all Means and Ordinances, when we come to Heaven; Word, Sacraments, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of Grace ſhall be no more; then means of Grace and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities ſhall be no more.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yet nevertheleſs there was a Golden Pot of it reſerved and kept by them for ever, being laid up before the Lord in the Holy of Holies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.33, 34. a Pot; it is called in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.4. a Golden Pot.</p>
               <p>So ſhall Chriſt remain, and all the Diſpenſations of him in this life, they ſhall remain in precious remembrance with the Saints in Heaven before the Lord to all eternity; Chriſt ſhall be laid up as it were in the Golden memories of the Saints, like Manna in the Golden Pot, for a memorial before the Lord; the Love of Chriſt and all the Diſpenſations of himſelf.</p>
               <p>They had likewiſe <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod bloſſoming laid up to the ſame end and purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:96313:95"/>The Saints ſhall remember in Heaven, how the Rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> budded, how the Miniſtry was bleſſed and made fruitful to them when they were in this World.</p>
               <p>So much as to the Manna or Bread from Heaven. You ſee how full it was of Chriſt and Goſpel Myſteries.</p>
               <p>A Fifth Typical thing of old was the Rock that followed them with Water iſſuing forth out of the Rock.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtory of this Type is in the 17th. Chap. <hi>Exod.</hi> ſee verſe 6. That it was a Type, is expreſſed by the Apoſtle a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4— <hi>which Rock was Chriſt.</hi> This Rock and the Water iſſuing out of it, was a Type of Chriſt and of His Spirit. It was a Diſpenſation often Celebrated by His people, to the praiſe of God in after times.</p>
               <p>But wherein did the Rock repreſent Chriſt? I ſhall but inſtance in four Reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to ſtrength and firmneſs, and ſtability. He is indeed <hi>the Rock of Ages,</hi> Iſai. 26.4. <hi>The Rock of eternity; Everlaſting ſtrength,</hi> as it is not unfitly interpreted by our Tranſlators— Iſai. 33.16. <hi>His defence is the Munitions of Rocks.</hi> Impregnable ſafety to his people, <hi>Their bread ſhall be given them; Their waters ſhall not fail</hi>— 1 Pet. 2.6. <hi>Behold I lay in Sion a chief Corner ſtone, elect, precious; and he that believeth in him ſhall not be confounded. The Church is built upon this Rock,</hi> Mat. 16.18. Hence a wiſe Hearer is ſaid to build his houſe upon a Rock. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to ſhadow and refreſhment. Iſa. 32.2. <hi>As the ſhadow of a great Rock in a weary Land:</hi> this World is a weary Land. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.6.5, <hi>The Sun ſhall not ſcorch by day, nor the Moon by night.</hi> Thoſe that dwell under the ſhadow of this Rock; thoſe that are in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is fitly reſembled to a Rock for offence and ſcandal acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, not in himſelf, but only accidentally through the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and luſts of Men. Hence he is called a Rock of offence, and a ſtone of ſtumbling, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8— <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.33. As it is writen (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.14. and 28.16.) <hi>Behold I lay in Sion a ſtumbling ſtone and Rock of offence; and whoſoever believeth on him ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. He is a Rock as to meanneſs and unlikelihood of that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Water. Who would expect or look for water out of a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:96313:95"/>
Rock? Therefore it is ſo often remembred with admiration, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.20.</p>
               <p>The Rock was of no great pomp to ſee to, but only a rude thing ſtanding in a vaſt Deſert.</p>
               <p>So in Chriſt to outward view, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. Neither is there any likelihood of ſalvation to be had in Chriſt, if men behold him only in his meanneſs, and look only at his abaſement with an eye of ſenſe and carnal reaſon, as the Jews of old did.</p>
               <p>And as the Rock repreſented Chriſt unto them: So 2. the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of it repreſented the Spirit of Chriſt. Joh. 7.37, 38, 39— <hi>Out of his belly ſhall flow Rivers of living water. This ſpake he of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is nothing more frequent in Scripture, then to expreſs the Spirit by water, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. and that moſt fitly, becauſe of the cleanſing and refreſhing vertue of it.</p>
               <p>But let us here conſider it in reference to the Rock from whence it came: and in this there is a four-fold Analogy obſervable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As the water iſſued out of the Rock, So the Spirit proceeds and comes from Chriſt— <hi>The Comforter whom I will ſend unto you from the Father,</hi> Joh. 15.26. To refreſh the weary ſoul when rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to faint away.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The water came forth out of the Rock when ſmitten with the Rod of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 17.6.</p>
               <p>So the Spirit proceeds from Chriſt, being ſmitten as it were with <hi>Moſes</hi> his Rod, with the curſe of the Law for our ſins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53— <hi>he was ſmitten of God and afflicted.</hi> Had not Chriſt dyed and ſuffered, we had never had any refreſhing water, never any Rivers of Joy and Conſolations from his Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next time the Rock muſt be ſpoken to, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.8. It ſeemeth that God in his unſearchable Wiſdom and Providence did ſo order it, That the Waters did ceaſe at this time, which had followed them Thirty eight Years. Hereupon the people mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, and their murmuring cauſes <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf to ſtagger at the Promiſe through unbelief. Though in this Moſes did miſs it too, for that he ſmote the Rock in ſtead of ſpeaking to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:96313:96"/>But this we may learn from it; Chriſt muſt be preached, as well as ſuffer for us; and in and by the ſpeaking and preaching of the Goſpel he doth communicate his Spirit: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ye the Spirit by the Works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith</hi>—</p>
               <p>As Chriſt ſmitten is the procuring cauſe of ſending the Spirit: ſo Chriſt preached is the inſtrumental cauſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is yet a fourth Analogy in this, that the Rock fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them; either the Rock it ſelf, or (as others) the Rock in regard of the rivers and ſtreams of water iſſuing from it.</p>
               <p>So doth the Spirit of Chriſt follow his people in all their changes and travels up and down in the wilderneſs of this world; when we run from Chriſt, he follows us. This Water of the Rock, the Spirit of God, purſues and follows them up and down from place to place, and from one condition to another.</p>
               <p>I ſhall cloſe with a threefold Improvement of this Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. We may here ſee that they had the Goſpel preached unto them, as well as we: For this ſpiritual Bread was Chriſt and the Rock that followed them was Chriſt: If they had not, all that I have preached to day, and ever ſince I begun upon the Types, it is all falſe Doctrine; for you know the ſcope of all hath been to let you ſee what of Chriſt, and what of Goſpel Grace and Truth was held forth under thoſe legal Types and Shadows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. This ſhould render Jeſus Chriſt precious, exceeding precious to us; for that he is every way ſuitable to our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: He is a Rock for ſupport: He is the Bread of Life, and the Water of Life, for Food and Nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Here is Comfort and Direction to poor, weak, hungry, thirſty Souls, whither to go, and to whom to repair for help, and for ſupply; here is a Rock and ſure Foundation for thy weak and weary Soul to reſt upon; here is ſpiritual Bread and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Drink: Therefore feed upon Chriſt by Faith, and this will fill thy Hunger, and quench thy Thirſt, and ſtay and ſupport thy weary Soul.</p>
               <p>But thou haſt been rebellious, and murmuring, and queſtioning the Truth and Goodneſs of the Lord: ſo was <hi>Iſrael. Moſes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

               <p>A Sixth typical thing amongſt them of old was the Brazen Serpent, the Hiſtory whereof we have in <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.5, 6, 7, 8. The myſtery and meaning of it we have by that infallible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14, 15.</p>
               <p>And ſo the paralleling and laying theſe two Scriptures together, the one whereof declares the Hiſtory of the Type, and the other reveals the Myſtery intended and aimed at therein, will be a great part of my Diſcourſe at this time.</p>
               <p>You ſee in the Hiſtory there be two things, the bodily Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and the Remedy.</p>
               <p>Now this ſhadows forth the ſpiritual Diſeaſe, and Remedy for the Soul.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſpeak firſt to the Diſeaſe, which was the deadly ſtinging of fiery Serpents for their Ingratitude, and Murmurings againſt the Lord.</p>
               <p>In this Diſeaſe there was a ſhadow of the ſpiritual Sickneſs of the Souls of men. And let it not ſeem ſtrange, that they ſhould have a typical repreſentation of ſpiritual Evils: For it hath been formerly ſhewed, when we opened the Nature of a Type, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. that all the Types are not to be reſtrained only to the Meſſiahs perſon, or to his Benefits; but they had dark and legal Adumbrations under the Old Teſtament, of all thoſe things and truths which are more clearly revealed under the New.</p>
               <p>That this was indeed a Typical Diſeaſe, is evident from the coherence that muſt needs be between the Diſeaſe and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, I mean thus.</p>
               <p>Such as the Remedy was, ſuch was the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>An outward Remedy ſuppoſes and implies a bodily Diſeaſe: a ſpiritual Remedy muſt needs relate to a ſpiritual Diſeaſe: but the Remedy here was ſpiritual and typical; for this our Saviour is expreſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. therefore ſo was the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:96313:97"/>Now for the Particulars wherein it was ſo.</p>
               <p>Having this general ground and foundation in the Scripture for it, as to the Particulars, we muſt beg of God Spiritual Wiſdom to accommodate and apply things rationally and ſcripturally, and not in a way of looſe and wanton wit and fancy.</p>
               <p>In the hope of whoſe aſſiſtance, through the help of your prayers, I ſhall inſtance only in 5. Particulars of ſpiritual Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction out of this Type, as to the diſeaſes of our Souls.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That Satan is indeed the Old Serpent.</item>
                  <item>2. That he is a fiery Serpent.</item>
                  <item>3. That ſin is the ſting of this Serpent.</item>
                  <item>4. This ſting of ſin is painful and deadly.</item>
                  <item>5. The Lord ſuffers thoſe moſt of all to be tormented and plagued by it, who deſpiſe Manna as a light Food.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. That Satan is indeed the Old Serpent. For this, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is expreſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9.</p>
               <p>He is ſo repreſented in Prophetical and Typical Scriptures, both becauſe that was the firſt Shape wherein he did appear as a Devil in tempting and deſtroying our firſt Parents; and for the ſubtilty and venome of that Beaſt, and the curſe inflicted upon him in that appearance.</p>
               <p>In darker places, as amongſt the Pagans of old, and amongſt the Americans of late; he hath delighted to appear unto them in that Shape of a Serpent: Therefore the Pagan Temples were wont to be haunted with Serpents, in ſo much that it grew into a Phraſe of Speech amongſt them. <hi>Sacer anguis.</hi>

               <p>They are alſo fitly called, fiery Serpents from their Colour. For they had a ſhining and gliſtering Skin, as if it had been made of Fire. And we ſee it in our ordinary Snakes that ſeem to ſhine and ſparkle againſt the Sun. So <hi>Taylor</hi> on the Types, <hi>pag.</hi> 305. Satan is fitly ſo called, as being a Serpent of the worſt kind, a moſt terrible and deadly Serpent. Hence he is elſewhere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>a great red Dragon,</hi> Rev. 12. upon the ſame account as here to <hi>a fiery Serpent,</hi> becauſe he is ſuch a dreadful enemy.</p>
               <p>This name <hi>Seraphim</hi> that is here uſed, is applyed to the holy Angels, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.2. For the ſpiritual brightneſs, and burning heat and zeal and love to God that is in thoſe bleſſed Spirits, thoſe pure flames. <hi>He hath made his Angels Spirits, and his Miniſters a flame of fire,</hi> Heb. 1.</p>
               <p>And Satan himſelf was ſuch a one at firſt, though now by his fall, he is but <hi>a fiery Serpent:</hi> He is a <hi>Seraphim</hi> debaſed and fallen below himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſting of this Serpent is ſin, Therefore the temptations of this fiery Serpent are called fiery Darts, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16. with which he ſtings the ſoul to death. He hath thruſt his Sting into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, and poyſoned it, and made it like himſelf. And he is continually tempting and thruſting in his Sting: Sin is called a Sting, 1 Cor. 15. <hi>The ſting of death is ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Sin the Sting of this Serpent, is painful and deadly poyſon: it both torments and kills.</p>
               <p>It is true, it is ſweet poyſon while under the tongue; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al it is tormenting and mortal in the Bowels, Job. 20.12, 13, 14. <hi>Though ſweet in his mouth, it is the poyſon of Aſps within him;</hi> ſweet in the commiſſion, but tormenting and deſtructive after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:96313:98"/>Oh the pain it puts the Conſcience of a ſinner too! Deadly pain and anguiſh; there is no anguiſh like it, no poyſon ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming, ſo tormenting to the Body, as Sin is to the Soul.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The occaſion of all this miſery, was their ſlighting and murmuring againſt the Manna wherewith the Lord had fed them from Heaven.</p>
               <p>There had been many murmurings before upon other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but now they come to ſlight and deſpiſe <hi>Manna</hi> wherewith the Lord had fed them ſo miraculouſly, for about eight and thirty years together: (for ſo ſome Interpreters compute the time of this murmuring.) All the while till now, though that Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs through which they travelled was full of fiery Serpents, and Scorpions, and Drought, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.15. Yet the Lord had not ſuffered any of them to be ſtung.</p>
               <p>But now he lets looſe theſe fiery Dragons to fly upon them, as Amos 9.3. <hi>I will command the Serpent and he ſhall bite them</hi>— and upon occaſion of their ungrateful murmurings againſt the <hi>Manna, Numb.</hi> 21.5. The Inſtruction we may learn and ſee in it is this, That God lets looſe thoſe fiery Serpents, Satan and their Luſts, to ſting the Conſciences and torment the Souls of Men, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Chriſt and Goſpel mercies.</p>
               <p>When Manna hath been ſlighted, when Chriſt is offered and rejected, then the Serpent ſtings. Pſal. 81.11, 12. <hi>Becauſe Iſrael would none of me; therefore I gave them up to their own hearts luſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Have you never felt the truth of this Type by woful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, how ſin hath raged and gotten more ſtrength, when the Goſpel hath been ſlighted, and offers of Grace deſpiſed?</p>
               <p>So much of the Diſeaſe, the deadly ſting of theſe fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents for their murmurings.</p>
               <p>Now 2. for the Remedy. The Brazen Serpent. That Chriſt is this Brazen Serpent, himſelf declares, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was made of Braſs, and in the ſhape and form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, yet not a real Serpent. It was not made of Gold, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Braſs; which though it be a ſtrong and bright Mettal, yet was contemptible in outward appearance, and moſt unlikely to have attained ſuch an end, to work ſuch a cure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:96313:98"/>So is Chriſt ſtrong and mighty, and bright and glorious, Rev. 1.15, 16. <hi>The brightneſs of his Fathers glory.</hi> Heb. 1.3. <hi>Yet a man, and the Son of man;</hi> Therefore low and mean in his outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and deſpiſed of the world. <hi>Chriſt crucified is to the Jews a ſtumbling block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs; but to them that are ſaved the wiſdom of God and the power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.23, 24. Yea he condeſcended to appear in the ſimilitude of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fleſh, for ſo the Apoſtle moſt accurately expreſſeth it, Rom. 8.3. <hi>He was counted a ſinner, but he was indeed without ſin,</hi> Heb. 4.15. As this brazen Serpent was like a Serpent, yet had neither Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom nor Sting: ſo Chriſt appeared like a ſinner. <hi>He came in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and yet knew no ſin.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. But though he was not ſinful, yet he was indeed under the curſe due to ſin, as the Serpent was curſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>So Chriſt became a curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This brazen Serpent was a Remedy and a Cure provided of God, in meer Grace and ſovereign Mercy for ungrateful and unworthy Rebels, when ſome of them were ſtung to death, and ready to periſh for their contempt of Manna; and others of them were dead, and gone, and paſt recovery for the ſame ſin.</p>
               <p>It was againſt the merit of their murmurings, when they ſpake againſt him, and againſt <hi>Moſes:</hi> in like manner doth God give his Son Jeſus Chriſt of free and meer grace, when we were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, without and againſt our merit; when ſo great a part of mankind periſheth without him in their own rebellions, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially for their contempt of the Goſpel. Joh. 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world,</hi> (it was a moſt intenſe love) <hi>to give his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him might not periſh, but have eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Serpent muſt be lifted up upon a Pole, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. That all Iſrael might ſee it, whether near or further off: ſo Chriſt was lifted up. Joh. 3.14. <hi>As Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up:</hi> that is, upon the Croſs — Joh. 12.32, 33. <hi>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. This he ſpake, ſignifying what death he ſhould die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:96313:99"/>And in the preaching of the Goſpel, in the ſight of all men. Gal. 3.1. <hi>Before whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth, crucified among you. Both to thoſe that are near and farr of,</hi> Epheſ. 2.17.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This brazen Serpent muſt be alſo looked upon by the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites when ſtung, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.8. So muſt Chriſt by the eye of Faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p>Faith is often expreſſed unto us by that Metaphor of looking. <hi>Look unto me all ye ends of the earth and be ſaved,</hi> Iſa. 45.22— Iſa. 65.1. <hi>I ſaid behold me, behold me.</hi> Faith looks with a fixed eye, and with a mourning eye. A mans Spirit is much ſeen and doth much diſcover it ſelf by his eye.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In this way it gave healing unto thoſe that being ſtung did look upon it, whom nothing elſe could heal; <hi>Moſes</hi> and his Law could not do it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.8.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you that fear my Name, ſhall the ſun of righteouſneſs ariſe with healing under his wings</hi>— Pſal. 103— <hi>who healeth all thy diſeaſes.</hi> And none but he can do it, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. There is no healing of a wounded Conſcience, but by Jeſus Chriſt alone, as lifted up upon the Croſs, and beheld by the eye of Faith.</p>
               <p>The brazen Serpents being lifted up was not enough, but it muſt be looked upon: ſo Chriſt muſt be believed on, or elſe the ſoul cannot be healed.</p>
               <p>Ignorant Souls that ſee not Chriſt, or that deſpiſe him, ſhall not be ſaved by him: as if any of the people had ſaid, what vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue can there be in ſuch a brazen Serpent to health, and ſo would not look up to it? Such, they deſervedly periſh: ſo do Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and Deſpiſers under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Though they were but weak and dim-eyed, blear-eyed, dim-ſighted, &amp;c. yet looking up to the brazen Serpent, they were healed: ſo, though Faith be weak, yet being ſincere it ſaveth.</p>
               <p>Though in the utmoſt parts of the Camp— ſome ſay it took up twelve myles; <hi>Yet look unto me all the ends of the earth and be ſaved,</hi> Iſa. 45.22.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The brazen Serpent retained this virtue, only while inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:96313:99"/>
by God for that end; and therefore when the ſacred Stamp of Inſtitution was taken off, we read no more of any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought by it: <hi>and Hezekiah brake it in pieces,</hi> 2. Kings. 18.4.</p>
               <p>Now this part of the Hiſtory cannot be fitly accommodated to Chriſt himſelf, but to his Ordinances, thus. That the very ſame things and actions which are good and uſeful when God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points them, are uſeleſs, yea abominable, if there be no ſtamp of Inſtitution upon them. Thus we may fitly apply it, becauſe the Types (as hath been ſaid) relate to all Goſpel Truths: and the ſame Truth ſhines forth in all the reſt of thoſe ancient Types and Shadows.</p>
               <p>The Lord then appointed miniſtring Garments, for his Prieſts and Miniſters: but for Miniſters to uſe ſacred Veſtments now, is unlawful and abominable.</p>
               <p>The Lord then appointed a kind of legal Hierarchy and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Supremacy of the High Prieſt, over all the reſt of the Prieſts and Levites; they were to act by the appointment of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.19. But for one Goſpel Miniſter to claim a ſupremacy of Jurisdiction over another Goſpel Miniſter, within his own Charge or Congregation; This is that for which we juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call the Pope <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord then appointed the Feaſt of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> and the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> and <hi>Pentecoſt:</hi> But for us to keep theſe Feaſts now, under the names of <hi>Chriſtmas, Eaſter,</hi> or <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> or the like, as the Pope hath taught us to do, it is a farr greater ſin then people do imagine: the retaining of ſuch legal Shadows being an implicite denyal of the Truth of the Goſpel: but men conſider not the meaning of their own Actions.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The laſt occaſional Typical thing which the Lord gave to his People of old, was <hi>thoſe healing Waters of the Pool of Betheſda,</hi> which indeed are not mentioned in the Old Teſtament, but in the New, <hi>John.</hi> 5. It was a Miracle; but yet it had alſo a ſymbolical uſe (as many other Miracles had) to lead them from the conſideration of earthly things, unto heavenly things.</p>
               <p>Healing Waters are often ſpoken of in the Scriptvre, with a reference to ſpiritual healing, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.1, 8, 9, 11— <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:96313:100"/>So Chriſt ſpeaks of Rivers of Waters flowing out of the heart of a Believer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38. which cannot be meant of literal Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but is meant of Metaphorical and Spiritual Waters; this in general. But to unfold the Allegory a little more particularly, that we may ſee more fully what inſtructions we may learn out of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thoſe healing Waters of that Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> may fitly repreſent the Ordinances of Chriſt in the Church; which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Betheſda, an houſe of mercy:</hi> for ſo the word may be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Beth cheſda, Domus miſericordiae,</hi> though others expound it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Domus effuſionis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church of Chriſt is indeed a ſpiritual Hoſpital, an houſe of mercy to the Sick, to poor diſeaſed Souls, where there be the choiſeſt Waters, the Waters of Life, and all other Medicines of ſpiritual help and healing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The healing virtue of the Water, may hold forth to us the ſpiritual good of Ordinances, the healing of our Souls. This is frequent in the Scripture, (as was ſaid before) for bodily healing to teach and repreſent ſpiritual.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The motion of the Angel, leads us to take notice of the effectual Operation of the Spirit of Chriſt, in and by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in the time of love.</p>
               <p>It is not the Means, it is not the Ordinances, but the Angel of the Covenant by his Spirit, moving and working in them, that heals and doth good to ſouls: the Ordinances are not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual at all times, but only when and as they are moved and influenced by the Spirit: for it was a place much frequented, as appears by the five Porches, and its neerneſs to the Temple: and the Text ſaith <hi>many ſick lay there.</hi> He could have healed all as well as ſome: <hi>Verùm ut miracula ſuum habent finem, ita &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum habere debent. Calvin in loc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As when there were ſo many dead, and but one raiſed, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.32— So many Widows, and the Prophet ſent but to one, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.9. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.25, 26.</p>
               <p>Who would have looked for help and healing from troubled Water? We muſt follow God againſt our own reaſon: the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:96313:100"/>
of reaſon is often contrary to the mind of God. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Naaman</hi> thought waſhing in <hi>Jordan</hi> an unlikely means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Leper— <hi>Eliſha</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.20. healeth the Waters by caſting in Salt; an unlikely means: for Salt is wont rather to cauſe barrenneſs.</p>
               <p>The Water here did it not, for then it would have healed all, and at all times, one as well as another. He ſingles out one whoſe condition was moſt deplorable, his diſeaſe inveterate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable 38. years. So he that was born blind, and had been ſo, till he grew up to mans eſtate. Cap. 9.1— So <hi>Lazarus</hi> when dead, buried four days, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.39. The Woman twelve years, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.20. Another eighteen years, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.11.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe times were unknown and uncertain to the people, they knew not when the Angel would come to move the Waters.</p>
               <p>So is the day of grace, and the opportunities of ſalvation to Souls: becauſe <hi>man knoweth not his time, Therefore is he ſnared in an evil time, when it falleth ſuddenly upon him:</hi> Eccl. 9.12. <hi>Oh that thou hadſt known!</hi> Luk. 19.41, 42.</p>
               <p>Therefore Eccl. 11.6. <hi>In the morning ſow thy ſeed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowſt not whether ſhall proſper, either this or that, or whether they both ſhall be alike good.</hi> Lay hold upon all opportunities.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Theſe excellent Waters did not heal all, but only him that was put firſt into them: which was for our inſtruction, that we might learn to lay hold betimes upon ſeaſons and opportunities, for our ſpiritual good: <hi>They that ſeek me early, ſhall find me.</hi> Prov. 8.17. Be at work for God and your Souls betimes, leſt you come too late.</p>
               <p>Chriſt asks him verſ. 6. <hi>Wilt thou be made whole?</hi> He prevents him before he expreſſed any deſire to Chriſt; not as though Chriſt were ignorant of his deſire, but to excite and ſtirr up de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and expectation in him; and to ſtirr up the attention of thoſe who were providentially preſent at that time, that they might mind and take notice of the Miracle. Verſ. 8. <hi>Jeſus ſaith to him, riſe, take up thy bed and walk.</hi> He could have ſaid, be whole; but he chooſes rather to expreſs it by an infallible effect
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:96313:101"/>
and fruit of it. To the Maid, ariſe, <hi>Mark.</hi> 5.42. To <hi>Lazarus,</hi> come forth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.43. and verſ. 44. <hi>Let him go.</hi> To the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytick.</hi> Mat. 9.6. <hi>Ariſe take up thy bed, and go unto thine houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the Sabbaoth day, that ſo it might be the more taken notice of; the people would wonder to ſee a man carry his bed abroad, and ſo inquire about it.</p>
               <p>There were (beſide theſe we have now handled) ſome other occaſional typical things, as <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, but that was ſpoken to in the Hiſtory of <hi>Noah,</hi> and ſome others may occur afterwards: but theſe are all I ſhall ſpeak unto here.</p>
               <p>Let me conclude with a few words of uſe, to help you to a practical improvement of all that hath been ſaid upon theſe Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may here ſee the compleat and perfect fulneſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to all the neceſſities of our Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſpiritual Ladder</hi> repreſents him as the Mediator and means of all the intercourſe between Heaven and Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The burning Buſh</hi> ſhews his preſence with, and protection of his Church and People in the Fires of Perſecution and Affliction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Pillar of Cloud and Fire</hi> holds forth that everlaſting bleſſed Conduct and Guidance of his People, by his Word and Spirit, through the Wilderneſs of this World to their eternal Reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Manna, and Water out of the Rock</hi> holds him forth, as our ſpiritual Food.</p>
               <p>And now laſtly <hi>the Brazen Serpent, and the Pool of Betheſda</hi> teacheth us, that here is healing alſo, ſo that he is both Meat, and Medicine.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing is held forth alſo under other Metaphors: Rev. 22.2. <hi>The Leaves of the Tree of life are for healing of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> ſo that Chriſt is all in all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Learn from hence not to deſpiſe theſe Truths concerning the Types, how weakly ſoever they may be held forth by him that ſpeaks unto you: for you ſee they are full of Goſpel mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and myſtery. Any thing of Chriſt ſhould be ſweet and precious, and it is ſo to you that believe.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:96313:101"/>3. We may here ſee the glory of Goſpel Truths and Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and withall how dull and ſlow of heart we are to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, in that the Lord teacheth us and holds them forth in ſo great variety of ſpiritual repreſentations, to our weak and narrow underſtandings.</p>
               <p>Here is Light and Safety, and Strength, and Meat and Drink, and Medicine, and all laid up in Chriſt, and Chriſt hereby held forth unto us: and all little enough to help us to a true and right <hi>Idea</hi> of him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Here is very great and ſweet encouragement from that which hath been ſaid this day, to diſeaſed Souls, to repair to this Phyſician; whatever thy diſeaſes be, go to him for help.</p>
               <p>And that you may obtain help and healing virtue from him, remember theſe three Rules and take them along with you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Seek to him in his own Means and Ordinances. If he ſet his Stamp upon a piece of <hi>Copper</hi> (as he did of old) do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe it. If he ſend his Angel into a Pool or Well of Water, do not ſay with <hi>Naaman, are not the Waters of</hi> Abana <hi>and</hi> Pharphar, <hi>as good as the Waters of</hi> Jordan?</p>
               <p>Are not other Pools as good as the Pool of <hi>Betheſda?</hi> They may be ſo in themſelves, and yet may not have the virtue that meaner Waters have, if the one be appointed of God for this uſe, and the other not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do not expect healing from the Means, from the Well, or Waters of it, but by the Angel of the Covenant moving the Waters; not from the Ordinances, but only from the bleſſing and preſence of God in them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be ſure you be found waiting his time and leiſure: wait at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> though you do not find help in 38 years; yet wait, and be ever ready, leſt you be out of the way, when the Angel moves the Waters.</p>

               <p n="1">1. There were typical Mercies, Deliverances, Preſervations of his People of old <hi>which happened to them in Types, and are written for our Inſtruction, upon whom the ends of the World are come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord intended thoſe ancient Diſpenſations to be Types and Patterns, and Pledges of what he intended to do for his People in the latter days.</p>
               <p>There be many ſignal Inſtances thereof, in the ſtory of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>I might here inſtance in the Lords protecting Providence over the Fathers and Anceſtors of that People, <hi>viz.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Their deliverance out of</hi> Egypt, the Hiſtory whereof is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Book of <hi>Exodus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Hiſtory may be typically applied three ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Unto Chriſt himſelf, and ſo it is expreſly in <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.15— It is quoted out of <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.1. Thoſe words are ſpoken by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> concerning the deliverance of that People out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> but this being typically done to the Members of Chriſt, was in the full intent of it accompliſht in Chriſt, the Head and Antitype: and therefore is ſo applyed by <hi>Matthew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Look as <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the Infancy of that People went down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and God brought them forth again: ſo Chriſt in his Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy fled thither, and the Lord called him back again.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here was alſo a ſhadow and repreſentation of our ſpiritual deliverance, out of ſpiritual bondage and miſery under Sin and Satan, and the World in an unregenerate eſtate, unto the ſtate of Grace and Glory. The Scripture hinteth this unto us, in that it doth expreſly apply the <hi>Terminus ad quem</hi> of their deliverance Myſtically and Allegorically: Therefore the <hi>Terminus à quo</hi> was alſo Myſtical and Allegorical: for there is the ſame reaſon of both.</p>
               <p>We made uſe of the like demonſtration before, upon the fiery Serpents: ſo here, ſuch as the Reſt was, ſuch was their Bondage: but the State they were brought into, was a State of typical Reſt and Peace in <hi>Canaan.</hi> It is made a Type of another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:96313:103"/>
even of Heaven it ſelf, Heb. 11.16. Heb. 4.8, 9. <hi>Joſhua did not give them Reſt: But there remaineth a further reſt to the people of God.</hi> If their Reſt in <hi>Canaan</hi> was a Type of ſpiritual and heavenly Reſt; Then their Bondage in <hi>Egypt</hi> was a Type of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bondage.</p>
               <p>Sin (as ſome have well ſaid) is indeed the <hi>Egypt</hi> of the Soul, upon all accounts: Temptations to it, Actings in it, Troubles for it, are its houſe of Bondage and Vexation. We are all by nature in a condition of ſpiritual ſlavery to Sin and Satan, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in outward ſlavery to their Egyptian Task-Maſters: and the Lord redeems us ſpiritually, as he did them literally.</p>
               <p>Hence in the Preface to the Ten Commandments which are moral and perpetual, the Lord therein ſaith to us, and to all his People, as well as to them: <hi>I am the Lord thy God which brought thee forth out of the Land of Egypt, out of the Houſe of Bondage.</hi> He redeemeth us out of another and worſer <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may ſee the Analogy a little more particularly in 4. things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were under very cruel Bondage. <hi>The Egyptians made them to ſerve with rigor,</hi> Exod. 1.14. They muſt make Bricks: the Monuments whereof are thought by ſome to be the <hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids.</hi> So <hi>Joſephus</hi> reports.</p>
               <p>Though ſome object that the <hi>Pyramides</hi> are not made of Brick. To which it may be anſwered, That what manner of Brick that was which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> made, cannot be now determined and found out, no more than what Materials the <hi>Pyramides</hi> were made of: yea, they muſt make Bricks without Straw, an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable piece of rigor and tyranny: and their Male-Children were to be drowned: a Law the moſt barbarous and inhumane that ever was then acted amongſt men: which how long it ſtood in force, the Scripture expreſſeth not. The Jews have a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that it was ten Months: but whether it were a longer or a ſhorter time, in this blackeſt time and Midnight of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion <hi>Moſes</hi> was born, who afterwards delivered them. But a moſt bloody and barbarous Law it was: and which is yet worſe, theſe Egyptian Tyrants would not let them have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their Conſciences to ſerve and worſhip God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:96313:103"/>So is the Bondage of Sin and Satan, very ſore and hard Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. The ſervice of a Luſt, the bondage of a baſe Luſt, is worſe then any Turkiſh or Egyptian Bondage, to do the Devils drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery: <hi>Thou haſt wearied thy ſelf with the greatneſs of thy way.</hi> Iſa. 57.10. Sinners take much pains, endure much labour, and hardſhip in the ſatisfying of their luſts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though they did ſigh under their bondage, and they had none to help; yet when help was offered, they had no heart to receive it, and cloſe in with it; but did fooliſhly and frowardly refuſe and reject it. <hi>They refuſed Moſes,</hi> Exod. 2.14. Act. 7.25, 35. So Sinners in their natural bondage, they will ſometimes cry out and complain of their ſins, but yet refuſe offers of Grace. When the Lord comes to deliver them, <hi>they hold faſt deceit, and refuſe to return.</hi> Jer. 8.4, 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When they began to think of getting free, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> purſues them with all his might: all the Land is in an uproar, whereas all was quiet before, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.5, 9. And they are brought to a deſperate ſtrait, the Sea before them, the Mountains on each hand, their Enemies behind them at <hi>Baal zephon,</hi> Exod. 14. So doth Satan, when the Soul begins to break looſe, then <hi>Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub</hi> roars; he lets it go on quietly till then, but then purſues it with dreadful temptations. Luk. 11.21. <hi>When the ſtrong man armed keeps the houſe, all is in peace;</hi> but when a ſtronger then he comes to diſpoſſeſs him, then he rages, and often drives it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſperate ſtraits and diſtreſs of Spirit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet notwithſtanding all this oppoſition, the Lord delivers them, and brings them forth with a mighty hand and with an out-ſtretched arm, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. So he brings forth the Soul in deſpite of Satan from out of its natural condition, by the outſtretched arm, and by the almighty power of the Holy Ghoſt; convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace is irreſiſtible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Iſraels</hi> deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> of old, was a Type of the New Teſtament Churches deliverance from the Yokes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. For <hi>Egypt</hi> is expreſly made <hi>a Type of Rome,</hi> Rev. 11.8.</p>
               <p>To be under the yokes of men, under Antichriſtian bondage, it is worſe than Egyptian bondage: for that was chiefly over the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:96313:104"/>
bodies, but this over the Souls of men, this is <hi>Romes</hi> Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, <hi>Rev.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>8.</p>
               <p>That men muſt have their Conſciences kept in the Pocket of a baſe Prieſt at <hi>Rome;</hi> for him to oppreſs their Conſciences and exerciſe dominion over their Faith, what fearful ſlavery is this?</p>
               <p>Hence alſo to make the Parallel yet a little clearer, look as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſang when they came forth out of literal <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in like manner when the Churches of the New Teſtament came forth out of Antichriſtian bondage, they are ſaid <hi>to ſing the ſong of Moſes and of the Lamb.</hi> Rev. 15.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another typical Diſpenſation of Deliverance and Mercy towards <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, was <hi>their Paſſage through the red Sea, as on dry Land:</hi> the Story whereof is recorded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>A very great and mighty work of Providence, and very often celebrated with triumphing praiſes to God, in after times. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.12, 13. and <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.8, 9. and often in the <hi>Pſalms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sea they paſſed through is <hi>called the Red Sea:</hi> the reaſon of which name is thought to be from <hi>Eſau,</hi> who got the Sirname of <hi>Red,</hi> and whoſe Seat and Habitation was bordering upon this Sea. The place where they paſſed over, I find in <hi>Geographers</hi> that it was <hi>four Myles broad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The means was by <hi>Moſes ſtretching forth his Rod, and the Lord ſending an Eaſt Wind,</hi> verſ. 21. The Waters ſtood as a Wall: not in the ſhape and figure of a Wall, (for then it is not likely that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as mad as they were, would have dared to have purſued them) but probably in the ordinary figure that other Waters uſe to have: but they did ſerve to the uſe of the Wall on each ſide the Camp, to keep off the <hi>Egyptians</hi> that they could not incloſe the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and compaſs them about.</p>
               <p>That this was a typical Diſpenſation, the Apoſtle doth affirm here in the Context, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2. The Myſtery of it was this; it repreſented Baptiſm, and that both in the outward form, and the inward good of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here was a manifeſt Repreſentation of the outward Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: for here was an application of the Element of Water by <hi>Moſes</hi> the Miniſter of God, unto the whole Church of God, who
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:96313:104"/>
were ſix hundred thouſand Men, beſides Women and Children: <hi>Theſe were all baptized by</hi> Moſes <hi>in the Sea:</hi> but how was the Water applied to them? The <hi>Egyptians</hi> were drowned and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in it; but there was no contiguous application of it to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> otherwiſe than what drops of Water might be blown upon them by the Wind, that ſtrong Eaſt-Wind: but they paſſed through the place of that Element, and ſo here was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>yptian Enemies were drowned in it: So when the Iſrael of God are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting and making their eſcape to the ſpiritual Reſt, they ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the ſwelling Waves and Billows of the Wrath of God ready to ſwallow them up, and the Iniquities of their heels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Prince and Powers of Darkneſs purſuing them: but Jeſus Chriſt drys up theſe Floods and deep Waters of the Wrath of God for all his People, and is as a Wall of ſafety to them on each hand, and leads them ſafely through it.</p>
               <p>But he cauſeth theſe Floods to overwhelm their Enemies, he triumphs over them in his fury, over Principalities and Powers and all implacable Adverſaries; he kills and buries Sins and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, that they can no more riſe up to hurt his people, than a drowned <hi>Egyptian</hi> can to hurt an <hi>Iſraelite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Wrath of God is often compared in the Scripture to Floods and deep Waters, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.1, 2. God is ſaid <hi>to be with his people when they paſs through the Waters,</hi> Iſa. 43.2. And he is ſaid <hi>to drown their ſins in the depths of the Sea,</hi> Micah. 7.19. And as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was thus Conducted ſafe <hi>in the morning Watch,</hi> Exod. 14.24, 27. So <hi>Chriſt in the morning Watch of his Reſurrection, and in the morning of the general Reſurrection and laſt Judgment,</hi> triumphs over all the Enemies of his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.14. Then his Church is fully paſſed from death to life, eternal life; then may <hi>Iſrael ſing the Song of Moſes and of the Lamb, and ſay, the Lord ſhall reign for ever, and ever.</hi> Exod. 15.18.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:96313:105"/>Much Teaching, and many other Inſtructions might be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all the Circumſtances of this Diſpenſation. The <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> here, met with a puniſhment ſuitable to their ſin. They had drowned the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and now fourſcore years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they themſelves are drowned in the <hi>Red Sea:</hi> and from the ſore diſtreſs that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in, the Sea before them, their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies behind them, the Mountains on either ſide; inſomuch that they had no other choice, in the eye of reaſon, but either to be drowned or ſlain. We may here obſerve, that the moſt glorious Deliverances of the Church, are in their greateſt ſtraits and moſt deſperate diſtreſſes: we may alſo obſerve the invincible ſafety of the Church of God in all Tryals, under all troubles.</p>
               <p>The Fire cannot burn them, as you have ſeen before in the <hi>burning Buſh,</hi> which burnt, and was not conſumed: the Sea can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not drown them; you have formerly heard of <hi>Noah floating upon the Waves in an Ark of ſafety,</hi> when all the World was Sea; and now you ſee <hi>Iſrael ſafe in the bottom of the Sea.</hi>

               <p>Oh!

This World is but a Wilderneſs, an howling Wilderneſs, full of <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Leopards,</hi> ſins and troubles, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.8. full of fiery Serpents, and Scorpions, and Drought: as thoſe <hi>Arabian</hi> Deſerts were.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may here ſee as in a Glaſs, the Corruptions of our own hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:96313:105"/>That this was a great part of the meaning of this Type, the Apoſtle ſhews at large in many Verſes of the Context, <hi>v.</hi> 5. to 10.</p>
               <p>Look what <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, and how they carried it in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we are apt to do the like: we are apt to think they were a very murmuring froward People: but if thou hadſt been in their Circumſtances, thou wouldſt have done as bad as they.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The periſhing and miſcarrying of many Souls under ſome preparative and initial Works, is alſo here plainly held forth. For many of them periſhed in the Wilderneſs while they were <hi>in tranſitu,</hi> between <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So doth many a Soul after ſome beginnings and motions heavenwards. The Apoſtle applies it thus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1, 11. <hi>leſt any man fall ſhort after the ſame example of unbelief:</hi> and here 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. <hi>many of them were deſtroyed in the Wilderneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Their paſſing through Jordan under Joſhua's Conduct, the Prieſts bearing the Ark, going in before them, and ſtanding in the midſt thereof, till all the people were gone over.</hi> Joſhua 3.13, 17. and 4.10, 18.</p>
               <p>The ſignification of this, was (as the Diſpenſation it ſelf was) much after the ſame nature with their Paſſage through the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> but accompanied with differing Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>In general it repreſented and held forth Chriſt going before his people, and himſelf bearing their ſorrows that would have ſunk them: he wafteth them ſafely through all their ſorrows and miſeries, and through death it ſelf over unto their eternal Reſt.</p>

               <p n="5">5. And ſo this brings me to the Fifth typical Diſpenſation of Providence to them of old, <hi>viz. Their Entrance into</hi> Canaan <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the leading and conduct of the ſame</hi> Joſhua, who had led them through <hi>Jordan.</hi> The Hiſtory whereof is the main Subject of the Book of <hi>Joſhua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Myſtery of this Diſpenſation is plain and obvious. <hi>Canaan</hi> was a Type of Heaven; it ſhadowed forth another and <hi>a better Country, that is an heavenly,</hi> Heb. 11.16. Their Reſt in the Promiſed Land ſhadowed forth <hi>another Reſt remaining for the people of God.</hi> Heb. 4.8, 9.</p>
               <p>Theſe things were partly ſpoken to, when we were upon <hi>the Perſonal Types,</hi> where we ſpake of <hi>Joſhua</hi> as a Type of Chriſt, the true Jeſus or <hi>Joſhua,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The laſt typical Deliverance that I ſhall mention, is <hi>their deliverance out of their Captivity in</hi> Babylon.</p>
               <p>Their Bondage in <hi>Babylon</hi> was a Type of ſpiritual bondage: their Deliverance, a Type of ſpiritual deliverance by Chriſt, and of his raiſing up his ſpiritual Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Hence it is obſervable, that the Prophets, when ſpeaking of that Recovery from <hi>Babylon,</hi> they paſs from that to Chriſt, and our ſpiritual Reſtoration through him: and they ſpake more magnificently of that, than was fulfilled in the Letter and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and they often intermix Paſſages that are plainly and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably meant of Chriſt, and of his ſpiritual Grace and Kingdom, of which that temporal Deliverance was but a taſte and Type. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.36, 37, 40, 41. alſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.15, 16. and in very many other places,<note place="margin">See <hi>Calvin</hi> in loc.</note> the Prophets ſtill lead the people from that to Chriſt, in whom all the Promiſes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies are fully and perfectly accompliſht.</p>
               <p>Moreover <hi>Babylon</hi> was a Type of <hi>Rome,</hi> and conſequently their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> a Type of the Churches delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the New Teſtament from under the Yoke of <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> and the Circumſtances alſo agree.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:96313:106"/>1. That it was a gradual work: for ſome came back with <hi>Zerobabel,</hi> others afterwards with <hi>Ezra,</hi> and others laſtly with <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> So is the Reformation out of Popery. The firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers were not infallible; therefore could not reform all things at once.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It met with much oppoſition, and was carried on through great difficulties: and of all their Enemies, the <hi>Samaritans</hi> did moſt obſtruct them, of whom you read 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 17. that <hi>they ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Lord, and other Gods.</hi> and <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.1, 2. When rejected, then they brake out into open oppoſition: and again in the New Teſtament, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9. whereby it appears that they did believe and expect the <hi>Meſſiahs</hi> coming, as well as the <hi>Jews, Joh.</hi> 4.20. and again <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.9. they are there deſcribed. The Sum is, they had a kind of mongrel Religion made up partly of <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> and partly of <hi>Paganiſm.</hi> So now when the Church of God under the New Teſtament, is coming forth out of ſpiritual <hi>Babylon:</hi> There is a mongrel Generation riſen up, whom ſome have fitly called <hi>Calvino Papiſtas, Calvinian Papiſts,</hi> who are <hi>for the Proteſtant Doctrine, and for Popiſh Worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I refer it to every ones Conſcience, to judge whether it may not be fitly applied to our late Innovators, who are for a Linſey-woolſey Religion, a mixture of ſound and wholſome Doctrine, with Antichriſtian popiſh worſhip: their Wine is mixt with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the Proteſtant Faith, with popiſh Ceremonies and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: they build Hay and Stubble upon the Foundation.</p>
               <p>The Foundation of our Church is right, which is Jeſus Chriſt, and Juſtification by Faith in his blood: but the Superſtructure they build upon it, is humane Inventions and Superſtitions: which is not Gold and Silver, pure Worſhip, and wholeſome Diſcipline; but <hi>Hay and Stubble, and the day will diſcover it,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Typical vengeance and deſtruction upon the Enemies of his people.</hi> For as the <hi>Jews</hi> were a typical people, and did prefigure and repreſent the whole Church of God under the Goſpel: So the neighbour Nations with whom they had to do, were alſo Typical of Goſpel Enemies to the Church; and their Sins and

               <p>By the <hi>perpetual Types</hi> we intend ſuch as God by inſtitution ſettled and ſtated in that Church, to the end of that Age, of that whole Old Teſtament Diſpenſation, till the coming of Chriſt the Truth Subſtance and Scope of them.</p>
               <p>Of theſe we are now to ſpeak, as the Lord ſhall enable us, it is the Scripture Phraſe, it calleth them <hi>perpetual Statutes or ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Statutes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Phraſe is firſt uſed, as I remember, in reference to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which is called <hi>Berith Yolam, a perpetual Covenant.</hi> Gen. 17.7, 8.</p>
               <p>Afterwards we have it again concerning the Paſſover, Exod. 12.14, 17. which is there called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Statutum ſaeculi, an everlaſting Statute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See likewiſe Exod. 27.21. and 28.43. <hi>A Statute for ever.</hi> and 29.9. <hi>A perpetual Statute:</hi> ſo <hi>Levit.</hi> 3.17. and 24.9. An <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Statute,</hi> Levit. 16 34. And indeed this Phraſe of Speech doth occur between twenty and thirty times in the Books of <hi>Moſes. It ſhall be a perpetual Statute,</hi> or <hi>an everlaſting Statute,</hi> or <hi>a Statute for ever throughout your Generations,</hi> that is, a ſtanding Type, and not meerly tranſient and occaſional.</p>
               <p>Only there hath been ſome miſtake and miſunderſtanding of this Phraſe, which muſt be cleared before we leave it.</p>
               <p>The unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> have ſeemed to interpret and underſtand it, concerning an abſolute Eternity, which hath been one occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or pretence alledged by them, for their ſtumbling at Chriſt and at the Goſpel, becauſe he hath removed and taken away the Law of Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>But beſides many other things that might be ſaid, to ſhew the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:96313:110"/>
weakneſs and folly of their pretence in this matter, I ſhall but note theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this word, <hi>for ever,</hi> is often uſed in Scripture for a limited duration. As for inſtance, it is uſed for duration till the year of Jubilee. Exod. 21.6. <hi>He ſhall be a ſervant for ever,</hi> that is, only till the year of Jubilee, in caſe he lived ſo long. For then he was to go free by vertue of that Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.13, 28, 40, 41.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it is uſed for a continuance during life. As 1 Sam. 1.22. <hi>that he may appear before the Lord, and there abide for ever.</hi> Explained verſ. 28. <hi>Therefore alſo I have lent him to the Lord as long as he liveth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes it is uſed for duration, to the end of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Diſpenſation <hi>For all the Land which thou ſeeſt, to thee will I give it, and to thy Seed for ever.</hi> Gen. 13.15. The Land given to thy Seed for ever: which cannot be Interpreted concerning an unlimited Eternity, unleſs they will ſay, that God hath broke his Promiſe: for they have been Ejected and caſt forth of that Land theſe ſixteen hundred years. 1 King. 8.13. <hi>I have ſurely built thee an houſe to dwell in, a ſettled place for thee to abide in for ever.</hi> Pſal. 132.14. <hi>This is my reſt for ever, here will I dwell, for I have deſired it.</hi> He doth not dwell, nor manifeſt his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence there now: but God hath given them up to invincible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs and darkneſs, and prejudice in this particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There be manifeſt intimations in the Old Teſtament, that theſe Ceremonial Laws were not to continue always, but to ceaſe and be aboliſhed in the fulneſs of time. Jer. 3. <hi>They ſhall ſay no more the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord.</hi> Jer. 31. <hi>Not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers, but this ſhall be the Covenant, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But ſo much for the explication of this Diſtinction of the Types, into <hi>Occaſional,</hi> and <hi>Perpetual.</hi> You ſee the true ſenſe and meaning of it, and what clear Scripture ground there is for it.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>perpetual Types</hi> or <hi>everlaſting Statutes,</hi> are no other but that which we call the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the Ceremonial Law, whereof this Text ſpeaks, and lays down this Propoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:96313:110"/>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That the Law hath a ſhadow of future good things, but not the very Image of the things themſelves.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing is aſſerted and held forth, though in other words, but to the ſame ſcope and ſenſe in other Scriptures. As Rom. 10.4. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs, to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that believeth.</hi> Joh. 1.17. <hi>The Law came by Moſes,</hi> that is, the Law as oppoſed to Grace and Truth: <hi>but Grace and Truth by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Truth here is not oppoſed to falſhood, for <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake no lyes; but to Shadows and ſhadowy Promiſes: and ſo the truth of them, is the performance or accompliſhment of them, in oppoſition to the bare ſhadow and typical Promiſe of them. And this is called Grace, becauſe there is ſo much of that in the Goſpel, and ſo little of it (but on the contrary much of rigor and terror) in the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> So the ſenſe amounts to thus much: That <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered Law, that is, Shadows and Ceremonies, which were but legal, and dark and rigorous: but Chriſt brought in Grace and Truth, that is, the real and ſweet accompliſhment and performance, of all the good that <hi>Moſes</hi> had promiſed in that dark and low and legal way, which is conſonant to that we have here in the Text, that the Law hath the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, but not the very Image of the things themſelves.</p>
               <p>Here be Four things to be cleared.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What is meant by the Law.</item>
                  <item>2. What by theſe future good things.</item>
                  <item>3. What by the Shadow which the Law hath, and the very Image of them which the Law wanted.</item>
                  <item>4. What are the particular ſeveral parts of this Law of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, theſe <hi>perpetual</hi> or <hi>everlaſting Statutes.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. What is here meant by the Law?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> A Law, is a rule of Acting given by a Superior, who hath Authority and Power of commanding, to his Inferior: this is the general nature of a Law.</p>
               <p>God therefore being the ſupreme Lord and abſolute Sovereign over all his Creatures, is the Great Law-giver. James 4.12: <hi>There is one Lawgiver, who is able to ſave, and to deſtroy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All thoſe to whom God commits Power over others, may be
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:96313:111"/>
ſaid to give Laws to them: except ordinary Officers in the Church whom he hath intruſted no further, but only with the execution of his Laws, promulgated and recorded by himſelf, by his extraordinary Officers in the written Word.</p>
               <p>But Magiſtrates may be ſaid to be Legiſlators as to Civil Laws: of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt that delivered Laws in Writing to the People under him, which he received from the Mouth of God.</p>
               <p>Now the Laws delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> are referred in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to three Heads. Moral, Ceremonial, and Judicial, which are expreſſed by three words, <hi>Thorah</hi> or <hi>Mitſvah, Chuquim,</hi> and <hi>Miſhpatim:</hi> which words are ſometimes uſed and put together in the Scripture, to ſignifie theſe three ſorts of Laws, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Mitſvah, Chuquim</hi> and <hi>Miſhpatim:</hi> the ſame words <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.17. ſee <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.10— <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Thorah Aſher Tſivithi: the Law which I commanded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt ſort of Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> Moral, reſpects them as Men: the ſecond, as a Church: the third, as a Common-Wealth.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> the Moral Laws, are ſtill in force and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto all men in all Ages.</p>
               <p>The third ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> Judicial Laws are of a mixt nature, ſome being Hedges as it were, and Fences to the Moral Law: and ſome to the Ceremonial, and ſo they participate of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe Laws to whoſe defence they ſerve.</p>
               <p>The Judicials that ſerve to the defence of the Moral Law, have ſomething of moral equity and reaſon in them, and ſo are ſtill in force. As that <hi>he that ſheds mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed:</hi> this is a Fence which God hath ſet about the ſixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and ſo remains in force in all Nations, to all times and Ages unto this day.</p>
               <p>But others of theſe Judicials are ſet as Fences about the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, and ſo muſt needs be fallen together with it.</p>
               <p>Now the Law of which the Text ſpeaks, it is not the Moral, nor the Judicial as ſuch, but the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> called Epheſ. 2.15. <hi>the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances</hi> and Col. 2.14. <hi>the Hand writing of Ordinances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Text cannot intend the Moral Law, for that had no ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:96313:111"/>
of Goſpel benefits: nor the Judicial Law, as ſuch, for part of it was an Appendix to the Moral Law, and the other part was only for the defence of the Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>But the Ceremonial Law is here intended: for that was of a ſhadowy nature, it had a ſhadow of good things to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What are theſe future good things?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is the good things of the Goſpel, which may be ſaid to be future upon a double account.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Future, in reſpect of the Law, and Old Teſtament times.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Future, in reſpect of this life. So future good things, is eternal good things. <hi>Calvin in loc.</hi> ſee 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>It doth not yet appear what we ſhall be.</hi> Though we have the foretaſtes and beginnings of them already, yet the perfection of them is future, reſerved in Heaven for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. What is meant by the ſhadow of theſe future bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits? And what by the very image of the things themſelves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In a word, a Shadow here, is a dark and weak reſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and repreſentation of things. But the very Image of the things themſelves, is a clearer and better repreſentation of them.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle uſeth this <hi>Metaphor</hi> of a ſhadow, concerning the Moſaical Ceremonies. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. In oppoſition to Chriſt the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſubſtance thereof.</p>
               <p>Here he oppoſeth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Alluding (as it ſeemeth) to the rude draught and firſt delineation of a Picture by the Painter, and to the full perfection thereof, when drawn forth in all its Lineaments and Colours and whole Proportion. So the Shadow is the firſt rude Draught.</p>
               <p>The Image is a more lively and exact repreſentation. So the dark Shadow is aſcribed to the Law. The more lively Image to the Goſpel. The things themſelves are in Heaven. So ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters carry it, <hi>Vid.</hi> Mayer. Calvin <hi>in loc.</hi> And the Apoſtle hath ſome expreſſions looking that way in other Scriptures: as when he ſaith, that <hi>here we ſee but in a Glaſs darkly,</hi> that is, the Glaſs of Goſpel Adminiſtrations, wherein we ſee the lively Image and Picture (as it were) of Chriſt crucified, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>ſee as in a Glaſs.</hi> He is there comparing the Law and the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:96313:112"/>
Goſpel, <hi>But in heaven we ſhall ſee face to face,</hi> ſee 1 Cor. 13.12.</p>
               <p>Under the Law they had no more but the Shadow, but now under the Goſpel we have the very Image; we ſee things <hi>as in a Glaſs,</hi> but in Heaven we have <hi>the things themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now to ſum up all that hath been ſaid in Explication, the Doctrine amounts to thus much: That the Ceremonial Law hath a ſhadow, or a dark and weak repreſentation of the good things of that eternal future happineſs, the more lively Image and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture whereof, we have under and by the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. What are the ſeveral parts of this Law of Shadows and Ceremonies, theſe <hi>perpetual Types</hi> or <hi>everlaſting Statutes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a large Field. I ſhall refer them at preſent to five ſeveral Heads, omiting Sub diviſions, leſt they be troubleſome to weak memories.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The initiating Seal, to wit, Circumciſion.</item>
                  <item>2. Their Sacrifices and Purifications of ſin and of uncleanneſs.</item>
                  <item>3. The Temple and Tabernacle, and other holy places.</item>
                  <item>4. The Prieſthood, with the whole legal Miniſtry.</item>
                  <item>5. The Feſtivals or Legal Times and Seaſons.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Theſe five general Heads will carry us through this whole Subject of the Types. For the whole Ceremonial Law, and all or moſt of the Statutes of it, will come in under ſome of theſe Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The initiating Seal of thoſe times, which was Circumciſion, the firſt Inſtitution whereof we have in Gen. 17.10, 11. <hi>This is my Covenant which ye ſhall keep between me and you, and thy ſeed after thee: Every man child among you ſhall be circumciſed. And ye ſhall circumciſe the fleſh of your foreskin, and it ſhall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and you.</hi> Which is contracted and epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomized into a few words by <hi>Stephen,</hi> Act. 7.8. <hi>And he gave him the Covenant of Circumciſion: and ſo Abraham begat Iſaac, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed him the eighth day: and Iſaac begat Jacob, and Jacob be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat the twelve Patriarchs.</hi> Wherein he briefly tells us the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Shadow, and the meaning of this Type, namely, that it ſignified and ſhadowed forth the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their Sacrifices and Purifications for ſin, and for unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:96313:112"/>
of which Pſal. 40.6. <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou didſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: burnt-offering and ſin-offering haſt thou not required<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> with Heb. 10.5, 10.</p>
               <p>Many things will come in under this Head: for they had both Sacrifices of Expiation for moral ſins, and Ceremonies of Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for legal uncleanneſs and impurity.</p>
               <p>I put them both together, becauſe they did both aim at one Scope, namely the cleanſing and purging away of ſin.</p>
               <p>They had burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, peace-offerings, ſin-offerings, treſpaſs offerings.</p>
               <p>They had legal Uncleanneſſes of ſeveral ſorts: they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Meats, unclean Perſons, unclean Houſes, unclean Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unclean Veſſels: the ſaddeſt of all their ceremonial Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes, was the <hi>Leproſy,</hi> for all which they had Purifications anſwerable.</p>
               <p>The general ſcope of all which, was to ſhadow forth Jeſus Chriſt in his purifying cleanſing power and virtue, as cleanſing us from the guilt of ſin by his Blood ſhed and ſacrificed for us, and from the filth and power thereof by his Spirit dwelling and working in us. Therefore he is ſaid <hi>to offer up himſelf a Sacrifice for us.</hi> Epheſ. 5.2. and <hi>to waſh us, and cleanſe us.</hi> verſ. 26, 27.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Temple and Tabernacle, and the Utenſils thereof, with all their holy places. For they had many and divers of them: the whole Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was an holy Land. They had Cities of Refuge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was an holy City, Mount <hi>Sion</hi> was an holy Hill, the Temple was an holy Houſe.</p>
               <p>And before they had a ſixed Temple, they had (which was equivalent in ſignification, as well as like unto it in outward form) the Tabernacle. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.1, to <hi>verſ.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>All which ſignified and ſhadowed forth both Chriſt and the Church: Chriſt in his humane nature, the Church both as viſible, and as militant and myſtical, and likewiſe as triumphant in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Church of God is called his Houſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Prieſthood, with all the reſt of the Temple Miniſtry,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:96313:113"/>
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.2. They had, beſide the High-Prieſt, the other Prieſts and the Levites, ſome whereof were Porters, ſome Singers; And here the Temple Muſick comes to be conſidered: the High-Prieſt was an eminent Type of Chriſt, the true and great High-Prieſt of his Church.</p>
               <p>And all this Temple Miniſtry was a ſhadow of the true Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Miniſtry: which though they cannot be called Prieſts in the Popiſh ſenſe, yet they may be called Antitypical Prieſts. The further myſteries of all which legal Miniſtry, we ſhall open more particularly afterwards, the Lord enabling us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A Fifth of theſe <hi>perpetual Types,</hi> was the Feſtivals or Holy Times appointed by the Law, whereof they had many: their weekly ſeventh day Sabbaoths: their New Moons: their year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Feaſts: That of Tabernacles, Paſſover and Pentecoſt: their ſeventh year: their Jubilee of fifty years, containing the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſeven times ſeven: all which were <hi>a ſhadow of good things to come.</hi> Col. 2.16, 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This Text and Doctrine gives much light for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of that queſtion, whether the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, or Grace.</p>
               <p>The anſwer is, That the Law hath a ſhadow of the good things of the Goſpel, but not the very Image of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. There was a mixture in that Diſpenſation, you may take the Anſwer more fully in three Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The thing it ſelf adumbrated and ſhadowed forth in this Law of Ceremonies, is the future good things of the Goſpel: ſo that it was indeed a Covenant of Grace that they were under.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The manner of repreſentation of them was legal, and in the way of a ſhadow, not of a full and lively Image: ſo that it was a kind of legal Goſpel they had in thoſe times.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">Vid. on Heb. <hi>4.2.</hi>
                  </note>3. The carnal <hi>Jews</hi> made it meer Law, by ſticking in the ſhell and ſhadow, and rejecting the Goſpel, or the thing it ſelf that was adumbrated and ſhadowed forth unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. See the Juſtice of God in the rejection of the <hi>Jews.</hi> For might not <hi>Iſrael</hi> have underſtood? They did not want a

               <p>THis excellent Sermon and Apology of <hi>Stephen,</hi> the firſt Martyr of the New Teſtament; the Scope of it, is to ſhew them the variety of Gods Diſpenſations towards his people, together with the various Rebellions and Oppoſitions of the Sons of men againſt him, and ſo to convince them that the ſcope and tendency of them all was to lead to Jeſus Chriſt: and that as former Diſpenſations had been deſpiſed, ſo was this, which was the Glory of all the reſt. He goes over the Hiſtory of the Church, from <hi>Abrahams</hi> time to the time of Chriſt, in ſundry moſt eminent and principal Diſpenſations of God towards his Church. In this Verſe he is ſpeaking of the Diſpenſation of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:96313:114"/>
God to <hi>Abraham.</hi> He had ſhewed before how he had called <hi>Abraham</hi> out of his own Country, how he had promiſed him a Poſſeſſion, the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> how he had foretold the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Seed for four hundred years, and their Deliverance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward; how the Lord had given him the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and how (under the influence of this Covenant) <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born, and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the reſt of the Patriarchs.</p>

                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That God gave to <hi>Abraham</hi> the Covenant of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that is the Doctrine.</p>
               <p>That which I do deſign and intend, is a little explanation of Circumciſion, and of the Covenant thereof, (for that is the Phraſe here) and that in reference to our attendance upon God in this Ordinance of the New Teſtament Circumciſion, which we are now to wait upon him in.</p>
               <p>To open to you the nature of Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>You know there is an outward, and an inward part of it, as there is in all other Signs and Sacraments whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Something muſt be ſpoken.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of the Sign, the nature of the external Ordinance.</item>
                  <item>2. Of the Covenant that it relates to, and</item>
                  <item>3. What thoſe reſpects are wherein it doth relate to that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. For the external part of this Ordinance of Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>It was the cutting away the Foreskin of the fleſh of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Male ſeed upon the eighth day.</p>
               <p>The firſt inſtitution of this Ordinance, is recorded Gen. 17.10, 11. <hi>This is my Covenant which ye ſhall keep between me and you, and thy ſeed after thee, every man child among you ſhall be circumciſed. And ye ſhall circumciſe the fleſh of your foreskin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Lord did appoint the Seal of this Covenant to be in that part of the body, in his infinite Wiſdom and Soveraignty, a thing which carnal Reaſon would deſpiſe.</p>
               <p>There ſeems to be two principal accounts of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe thoſe Members of the Body are ſo much abuſed to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:96313:115"/>
ſin, in the way of uncleanneſs and filthineſs; therefore the Lord would now ſanctifie them, and ſeparate a Seed and Generation to himſelf: and uſually the greateſt Wrath of God to the Souls of men, is expreſſed by giving them up to abuſe thoſe parts of the Body.</p>
               <p>The World was grown very degenerate, and the Lord was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to leave a Monument, an everlaſting Monument of his Wrath for thoſe ſins in all Ages, and therefore deſtroys <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 18. and before this Deſtruction, he appoints this Seal and Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another account of it is this, that it might be a ſure and a ſtrong Wall of Partition, between the Jewiſh and Gentle Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World. It made the Partition Wall the ſurer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe carnal Reaſon could not but deſpiſe ſuch an Ordinance.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that know not God have no ſpiritual ſenſe of the thing, therefore we find the Heathens ſcoff at it: as <hi>Horat.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Curtoſque Judaeos. &amp;</l>
                     <l>—Credat Judaeus Apella.</l>
                  </q>
becauſe by their carnal Reaſon they could not ſee the reaſon of it. Therefore when the Lord would have both united to Jeſus Chriſt in one Body, he aboliſhes Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>This Ordinance was diſpenſed to the Males, the Females were included and comprehended in the Males, and as fully and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehended in them, as the Land and the Trees are ſaid to be Circumciſed: ſo are all the Daughters of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as they came of circumciſed Parents, and married to circumciſed Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands: and their Sons were circumciſed, ſo that it was a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Nation and People.</p>
               <p>It was to be done upon the <hi>eighth day</hi> after the Birth of the Child; and ſo in this Text, <hi>He gave him the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and ſo</hi> Abraham <hi>begat</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and circumciſed him the eighth day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon of this limitation might be, partly becauſe of the Infant ſtate of the Church in thoſe times; therefore the Lord teacheth them, and limiteth them even in ſuch ſmall particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which are now left to be determined only by the general
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:96313:115"/>
Rule of the Word, even the particular time and ſeaſon of our Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>Its thought alſo this might have ſome further myſtery in it, in reference to the Chriſtian Sabbaoth, which is the eighth day in one reſpect, the firſt in other ways of numbering; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect a new ſtate and life, after that the compleat and full num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the days of this life here are gone through; after the Week is ended, (the Week of this life here) we come to Heaven and Glory, which was one thing intimated in Circumciſion, as you will hear afterwards. But ſo much for the external part of this Ordinance, <hi>the cutting off the foreskin of</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Male ſeed, and that upon the eighth day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſpeak a little to the myſtery of this Ordinance, the meaning of it, the ſpirit of this external Diſpenſation. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Shell, there was a Kernel; beſides the letter of the Law of the Ordinance, there was much ſpiritual myſtery intended and aimed at in it. Now then what is the myſtery of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, the inward part of it, that is the Covenant. <hi>And he gave him the Covenant of Circumciſion.</hi> So that Circumciſion is the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and it is the ſame expreſſion where this Ordinance is firſt inſtituted: <hi>You ſhall have my Covenant in your fleſh,</hi> Gen. 17. It is called a Covenant, as other Signs and Sacraments are: it is a ſacramental Phraſe: the Lamb is called the Paſſover, the Bread the Body, the Wine the Blood of Chriſt: ſo Circumciſion is the Covenant of it.</p>
               <p>But what Covenant is it that Circumciſion doth relate to?</p>
               <p>This is the great Queſtion.</p>
               <p>You know there be two Covenants, that of Works and Grace.</p>
               <p>Now Circumciſion was not the Covenant of Works, but the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>That it was not a carnal Covenant, and a Covenant of Works; take theſe five Conſiderations to make good that ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceed any further: for if it be the Covenant of Works, it cuts off all that is to be ſaid, as to the ſpirit and myſtery of this Ordinance: all that you will hear afterwards, will be things belonging to the Covenant of Grace; therefore let us prove that
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:96313:116"/>
it is not a carnal Covenant that Circumciſion doth relate to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Jeſus Chriſt is not the Covenant of Works, but Chriſt is the Covenant of Circumciſion; and therefore it is not Works, but Grace. He is ſo called in Iſa. 49.8. <hi>I will give thee for a Covenant to the people.</hi> Now Chriſt was in Circumciſion, he was the Miniſter of Circumciſion, he is the Seed which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion relates to, <hi>I will be the God of thy Seed.</hi> This Seed is Chriſt, Gal. 3.16. <hi>Now to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his ſeed were the promiſes made. He ſaith not, and to ſeeds, as of many; but as of one, and to thy ſeed, which is Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt is the ſum and ſubſtance of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace: now this was the Covenant that God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſealed in Circumciſion, that he would give him a Seed, which Seed is Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Goſpel is Grace and not Works. The Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Goſpel, and therefore it is Grace, but not Works. It is the Apoſtles expreſſion that <hi>the Goſpel was preached to</hi> Abraham. Gal. 3.8. <hi>The Scripture foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the Heathen through faith, preached the Goſpel before to</hi> Abraham. There is no Goſpel of Works, for Works is Law, and bad tidings: if it be the Goſpel, it is the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If it was a Covenant of Works, it will follow, that <hi>Abraham</hi> and all the Old Teſtament Saints either were not ſaved, or elſe were ſaved without Chriſt, neither of which can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited. The truth is, if it were Works, it will follow, they were all damned, <hi>for by works ſhall no fleſh be juſtified and ſaved.</hi> If they were ſaved, and yet by Works, they were ſaved without Chriſt, but without Chriſt there is no ſalvation. <hi>In him, in this Seed ſhall all the Nations of the World be bleſſed,</hi> that is, by Jeſus Chriſt: no bleſſing and ſalvation without him, and therefore he and his Seed were ſaved by Chriſt, for Grace was in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To be a God to any man, this is not carnal, this is not Works, but Grace. It is true, God was a God to <hi>Adam</hi> before he fell: but to be a God to Sinners, this is Grace: he was a God to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency by virtue of the Covenant of Works, but he is not a God to any Sinner but in a way of free Grace.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:96313:116"/>
Now that was the Covenant, <hi>I will be a God to thee and thy ſeed,</hi> Gen. 17.7. <hi>Abraham</hi> was a ſinner, and a Child of Wrath by nature, as well as others; yet God was his God truly. For God to be a God to thoſe that never ſinned, there may be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: but for God to be a God to thoſe that have ſinned, this is Grace indeed. Angels are ſaved by Works, Sinners cannot be ſaved but by Grace. That ever the Lord ſhould condeſcend to engage in ſuch a Relation, as to give a Sinner intereſt in him, and propriety in him as his God, this is Grace; they that do not think this is Grace, they do not need Arguments, but pity and prayer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider that it was the fatal error and miſcarriage of the carnal <hi>Jews,</hi> that they did underſtand Circumciſion and all the reſt of thoſe ancient Types and Ceremonies, they did underſtand them all as a Covenant of Works, and herein they loſt Chriſt and their Souls. It is every where charged upon them as their ſin; it is that which all the Prophets and Apoſtles do endeavour with all their might, to beat them out of thoſe miſconſtructions of Circumciſion, and the Covenant of God in thoſe times.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle proves it at large in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. that it was Grace and not Works, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by. Now this was the error that all the carnal <hi>Jews</hi> fell into, that they took it to be a Covenant of Works: as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> they had a Righteouſneſs of their own, they were all of that Spirit; they took it all as Law, even the Goſpel and the Grace that was in the Covenant, and ſo fell ſhort of the bleſſings of it: therefore if our New Teſtament Circumciſion be practiſed by any as the Covenant of Works, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did when the Apoſtle preached to them, they will fall ſhort of Heaven. Now if they took it to be a Covenant of Works, ſhall we juſtifie their errors and miſcarriage againſt the whole preaching of the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>This is enough to ſhew that it is the Covenant of Grace, that Circumciſion doth relate to.</p>
               <p>Now briefly what is this Covenant of Grace? And what is the Grace of the Covenant that Circumciſion doth relate to?</p>
               <p>This is a very large Field. There were three parts of this
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:96313:117"/>
Grace of the Covenant that the Lord made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To be a God to him.</item>
                  <item>2. To give him a Seed.</item>
                  <item>3. To provide an Inheritance both for him and them.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And theſe three general Heads will comprize and take in the whole myſtery of Circumciſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt part of the Covenant is this, <hi>that God would be a God to him and his Seed:</hi> and this indeed is moſt comprehenſive, and includes all the reſt. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant, and be a God to thee and thy Children after thee.</hi> Gen. 17.7.</p>
               <p>And what is it for God to be a God, to be a God to a man? thy God, or a God to thee?</p>
               <p>It is, when he gives to a poor Creature a ſpecial intereſt and propriety in himſelf: ſo that God in his alſufficiency and effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency is ours, and we are his. All his Attributes and Works are ours, for our good. <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> that is, all my Attributes ſhall be thine, and for thy good, as really as they are mine for my Glory. The infinite Wiſdom of God ſhall contrive their good, whoſe God he is; the infinite Power of God ſhall effect it: the infinite Love of God is theirs; his Mercy, Truth, and all his Attributes are theirs. As his eſſential Power: ſo his working Power, or his actual Power. As he will be all to them: ſo he will work all for them. Now this, as I ſaid, includes and infers all the reſt: this is the firſt and moſt general.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he would give him a Seed, that was another part of the Covenant. Gen. 17.5, 6. <hi>Thou ſhalt be a Father of many Nations, thy name ſhall be no more called</hi> Abram, <hi>but</hi> Abraham. <hi>I will make Nations of thee.</hi> As God did lengthen out his name: ſo he would lengthen out his Poſterity, even to length of time.</p>
               <p>But now what is this Seed the Lord promiſed to <hi>Abraham?</hi> The queſtion is, whether it be a meer natural Seed, or a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Seed?</p>
               <p>Certainly it was not meerly a natural Seed; it is true, that is one thing that was the Shell and outſide of it; but the Kernel of this promiſe was a ſpiritual Seed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:96313:117"/>There was a fourfold Seed promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> above a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seed, and I ſhall prove each Particular out of plain Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That great Seed, that was not only the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but the Son of God: this was the firſt and chief Seed here intended, Gal 3.16. <hi>He ſaith not as to Seeds, but to thy Seed, which is Chriſt, ſuch a Seed in whom all Nations are bleſſed.</hi> Now it is in Chriſt only that all Nations are bleſſed, therefore he was this promiſed Seed.</p>
               <p>The Lord had not before limited the Seed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Family, but left it at large (ſo far as appears) among the whole Race of Mankind. It was ſaid to <hi>Adam, the Seed of the Woman,</hi> there was then no further limitation till <hi>Noahs</hi> time, and then in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, the Lord limits the Covenant to his Seed.</p>
               <p>It was afterwards confined to <hi>Judah,</hi> one of the twelve Tribes: at laſt the Lord went further to one Family in <hi>Judah,</hi> namely, <hi>Davids:</hi> but here he limits it to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>of him ſhould come that great and bleſſed Seed:</hi> This was the main thing indeed, as without which all other Promiſes could never be beſtowed and fulfilled; but through him they are Yea and Amen. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>ſaw my day and rejoyced,</hi> he ſaw the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to come of his Loyns; this was the Seed in whom he believed, and by which he was ſaved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was a Church-ſeed promiſed; the meaning is this, That the Church of God ſhould be continued in his Race and Poſterity, the true Religion ſhould be ſetled there.</p>
               <p>There were other godly perſons before and after: we read of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends, and it is very like there might be others: and when God had ſetled Salvation to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> it was the duty of all others to joyn themſelves to that Church. The Lord entailed by Covenant all his Ordinances to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity. <hi>He gave them his Statutes and Judgments,</hi> he choſe them to be a peculiar People, a People to the Lord; and that is a Church, a Society intruſted and inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Ordinances: and thus he dealt with them, <hi>he ſhewed his Statutes to</hi> Iſrael: this is no ſmall priviledge and mercy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Ordinances: this is called the Kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:96313:118"/>This Chriſt threatned the <hi>Jews,</hi> that it ſhould be taken from them and given to other people, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.43. that is God would ſettle his Church among the Gentiles, and give them his Ordinances. And that this is a Priviledge, we ſee by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> wherein he mentions it as a part of the dreadful miſery of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that they were <hi>Aliens to the Common Wealth of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There was a third thing intended, and that is a believing Seed, ſuch as ſhould be truly Godly: and of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks in Gal. 3.7. <hi>Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, are the Seed of</hi> Abraham: ſo that all true Believers are his Seed in that ſenſe. He is called <hi>the Father of the Faithful,</hi> all Believers are his Poſterity. There were Multitudes that were truly Godly of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, and all that are Godly are his Seed; they walk in his ſteps, they are the Seed of the Covenant, they are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually related to him. He was the Pattern and typical Head of that Covenant, in which we do all believe, the Pattern of Faith to us: He is called our Father. It is ſaid of him, that <hi>he believed againſt ſenſe and reaſon,</hi> this was not writen for his ſake alone, but for us alſo that we might follow his ſteps.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There was included in this Covenant an ingrafted Seed: it is the Apoſtles expreſſion in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. I mean, a Seed not only of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but of the Gentiles God did not only engage to <hi>Abraham</hi> that there ſhould be Church of his own natural Seed, and that there ſhould be Saints of his natural Seed, but that the Gentiles ſhould be ingrafted into his Covenant, and ſo become his Seed. <hi>Thou being a wild Olive Tree wert grafted in among them, and partakeſt of the root and fatneſs of the Olive Tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God did above and beyond the ordinary courſe of things, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graft the Gentiles into that Covenant that he had once made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus you ſee what the Seed is which the Lord did pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſe in the Covenant, whereof Circumciſion was the Seal. He did promiſe to give to <hi>Abraham</hi> that Seed, firſtly and chiefly that Seed, who was the Son of God; and a Church Seed, and a believing Seed, and not only a Seed of the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:96313:118"/>
but a Seed ingrafted into that Grace and Covenant from among the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>We have gone through two Branches of the Covenant: the third is this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That God would give an Inheritance to him and them; this was the third part of Gods Covenant with him.</p>
               <p>It is the greateſt deſire in nature to have Children, and it is a good deſire, it is of God. And what do Parents deſire next? a comfortable Inheritance for them: and this did the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Abraham.</hi> And in that Text which hath been ſo often alledged, God firſt promiſes to make him exceeding Fruitful; and then, <hi>I will give to thee and thy Seed after thee, the Land wherein thou art yet a Stranger.</hi> The Lord promiſed an Inheritance, and that Inheritance was the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Queſtion is, whether this was a temporal or ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Inheritance?</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs the Lord did not promiſe to <hi>Abraham Canaan</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a temporal Inheritance, but as a ſpiritual Inheritance. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> was not as other Lands are, a meer outward thing; but it was a typical Land, it was the Land of <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> it is the Land of Glory. <hi>Canaan</hi> was a Type of Heaven, and in that reſpect it was that they did ſo earneſtly prize it, and look upon it as being Heaven in an earthly Shadow, therefore <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> muſt needs be buried there: therefore the Apoſtle aſſures us, they did ſeek a better Country, they profeſſed themſelves Strangers and Pilgrims here upon Earth; <hi>They that ſay ſuch things declare plainly, they ſeek another Country which is an heavenly one; wherefore God is not aſhamed to be called their God.</hi> It is a heavenly City, whoſe Builder and Maker is God: ſo that under that Shadow the Lord did promiſe Heaven to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and this was the third part of this Covenant. This Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> is called <hi>the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Holineſs:</hi> what expreſſion can be higher? <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. and therefore the Saints did look beyond that to another Country.</p>
               <p>You ſee what the Covenant was, and what were the principal things and Branches of it: That God ſhould be his God, that God ſhould give him a Seed, and that God ſhould give an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance to him and them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:96313:119"/>You ſee what the Covenant is that Circumciſion doth relate to.</p>
               <p>Now the laſt thing that was propounded was this, what reſpect it is that Circumciſion hath to this Covenant? <hi>He gave him the Covenant of Circumciſion.</hi> For this, Note theſe five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Circumciſion reſpects the Covenant as the Seal or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Initiation into the Covenant.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this laſt queſtion is, becauſe that all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Inſtitutions of thoſe times, they did all relate to the ſame Covenant. Every Ordinance did, but with ſome peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity, with ſome ſpecial reſpect, and in a peculiar manner.</p>
               <p>Now Circumciſion hath this peculiar reſpect, it was the Sign of Initiation. The Scripture uſeth all thoſe words, and they are fitly uſed <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. it is called <hi>a Sign and Seal of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith:</hi> and all the fixed Signs of the Covenant of Grace are Seals alſo; there are no <hi>nuda Signa.</hi> As they are Signs to repreſent: ſo they are Seals to ratify and confirm the Covenant of Grace, and the bleſſings of it, and alſo means to exhibit them, as you know the nature of Sacraments is ſo.</p>
               <p>So then Circumciſion it was a Seal and a Sacrament, in the way of a Type: it was <hi>a typical Sacrament.</hi> We have Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments now, but ours are not typical, are not ſhadows of good things to come, and of the Goſpel and <hi>Meſſias</hi> yet to be exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but it is paſt and done in our times: but Circumciſion was ſuch a Sacrament, as was to be a Type of the future exhibition of the Covenant and bleſſings of it: and it was the Type or Sign, or Seal and Sacrament of Initiation: or of entrance or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn admiſſion into the Covenant: for it was to be the firſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Paſſover, as you know it was appointed and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. Circumciſion was firſt to be adminiſtred: not that perſons were admitted by Circumciſion into the Covenant or Church of God; no, they were in the Covenant before, elſe they were not to be admited to Circumciſion; they have no right to the Seals of the Covenant, that are not firſt in the Covenant.</p>
               <p>It is a common miſtake in our times, that many think that Baptiſm doth make a perſon a Member of the Church of God, it doth ſeal memberſhip, or elſe they have no ground to have it adminiſtred to them: this is the firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:96313:119"/>2. As holding forth the ſuffering of Jeſus Chriſt: he is the principal Seed whereof the Covenant ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>Circumciſion was a bloody Sacrament, and the firſt blood that Jeſus Chriſt ſhed, was in Circumciſion: you know he was circumciſed the eighth day, and ſo it had a reſpect to that, to ſhadow forth that, and the whole ſtate of his humiliation: and ſo it was ſome part of that attonement and expiation that Chriſt made for our ſins.</p>
               <p>It is not only the laſt act and the laſt ſuffering, the ſeparation of his Soul and Body; but all his ſorrow he underwent from the Cradle to his Grave: all theſe were parts of the price paid to Gods Juſtice for us. Now Circumciſion did foreſhew this, for it was a Sacrament very painful to the fleſh, and a Sacrament wherein ſome blood was ſhed in the circumciſed part.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It did in a ſpecial manner, ſhadow forth the great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Righteouſneſs that we do receive by Faith, the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus Chriſt for our Juſtification. The Apoſtle is expreſs in Rom. 4. <hi>He received the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> Circumciſion was not a Seal to <hi>Abraham</hi> before he did believe, that were a ſtrange thing indeed: but in the true nature of the thing, and in the deſign and intendment of the Ordinance, it was a Sign and Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</p>
               <p>We are juſtified by Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we believe in, is imputed to us for our Juſtification: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle diſputes very clearly and ſtrongly, That <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did receive Circumciſion after that he did firſt believe unto Righteouſneſs; and ſo Circumciſion was a Seal of that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which he was poſſeſt of, before his Circumciſion: <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. for they were all to look to Chriſt by Faith, by virtue of their Circumciſion; and if they did not, it was their great ſin, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and error, as indeed the carnal <hi>Jews</hi> did not: that is the third.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Circumciſion had a ſpecial reſpect to another great bleſſing of the Covenant, and that is, Mortification, or the cutting off the ſuperfluity of Naughtineſs and Corruption: therefore the Lord promiſes <hi>to Circumciſe their hearts,</hi> or to cut off the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin of their hearts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. therefore he often blames them,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96313:120"/>
that they were not circumciſed in heart. That ſhews that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion did look at the work of Mortification in the heart: and not only at Mortification, but alſo at Holineſs or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation of the heart, life and whole man: it looks at the cutting off of the ſuperfluity of ſinful Corruption, therefore Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is expreſt in that way of Uncircumciſion: the unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiedneſs of any part, is in Scripture expreſt by the uncircumciſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it. <hi>I am a man of uncircumciſed lips:</hi> you know his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, that is, corrupt, not ſo mortified as I ſhould be. Act. 7.51. <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked, and uncircumciſed in heart and ears.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is called the Circumciſion made without hands; Col. 2.11. <hi>In whom alſo ye are circumciſed with the Circumciſion made without hands.</hi> What doth he mean by this? but putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, through the Circumciſion of Chriſt: this is the fourth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It had a ſpecial reſpect to ſhew and ſhadow forth, the New Teſtament Ordinance of Circumciſion. And what is the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in ſtead of Circumciſion under the New Teſtament? It is Baptiſm: therefore the Apoſtle makes an expreſs parallel between Circumciſion and Baptiſm. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. he makes them to be the ſame: <hi>Buried with him in Baptiſm, and circumciſed with ſpiritual Circumciſion.</hi> For look as Circumciſion was the initiating Seal then, ſo Baptiſm is now.</p>
               <p>As in Circumciſion there was cutting off the ſuperfluity of the fleſh: ſo in Baptiſm, there is a waſhing away of the filth of the body: they both reſpect Mortification. Thus you ſee in what particular ways and manners Circumciſion doth reſpect the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: and ſo you have ſeen both what the outward part is, what the inward part is, what the Covenant is, and in what particular manner it doth reſpect the Covenant: <hi>He gave him the Covenant of Circumciſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now all that I ſhall add, ſhall be this: Look as there was a groſs abuſe of the Ordinances under the Old Teſtament, of this Ordinance of Circumciſion: ſo there is of our Goſpel-Circumciſion: look as this Ordinance of Circumciſion might be made of none effect, and might be turned into a nullity, their
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:96313:120"/>
Circumciſion might become Uncircumciſion: ſo it is with many in their Baptiſm, their Baptiſm is no Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>It is the Apoſtles complaint in Rom. 2. <hi>If thou art Circumciſed, it profits thee, if thou be a keeper of the Law; but if thou be a break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it, thy Circumciſion is become <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion.</hi> Rom. 2.28, 29. <hi>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly, neither is that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which is outward in the fleſh: but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and Circumciſion is that of the heart, in the ſpirit, and not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God.</hi> The ſame holds concerning this Ordinance which Circumciſion doth hold forth. He is not a Chriſtian which is one outwardly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that Baptiſm which is outward in the fleſh: but he is a Chriſtian that is one inwardly, and Baptiſm is that of the heart, in the ſpirit, and not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God. The Apoſtles Scope, is to depreſs the external part of the Ordinance as of no worth and value, ſeparated from, or compared with, the ſpiritual part: ſo it is with our Ordinances, that we do enjoy under the New-Teſtament. What is the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the filth of the body, if the heart be not waſhed? But it is, as Circumciſion was to them, an aggravation of their ſin and condemnation. <hi>I will puniſh</hi> (ſaith God <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.25, 26.) <hi>all them which are circumciſed together with the uncircumciſed.</hi> Egypt <hi>and</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Edom, <hi>and the Children of</hi> Ammon <hi>and</hi> Moab, <hi>and all that are in the utmoſt Corners, that dwell in the Wilderneſs; for all theſe Nations are uncircumciſed, and all the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>are uncircumciſed in heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So God will puniſh the Baptiſed with the Unbaptiſed together. For many people are unbaptiſed in the fleſh, and many of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> many profeſſing Chriſtians are not baptiſed in heart. They have the Circumciſion, but not the Covenant of Circumciſion; they have the Water, but not the Spirit of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. Therefore take heed of ſeparating the outward part from the inward part of the Ordinance, do not reſt in the external pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg, but look after the ſpirit and bleſſing of every Ordinance: get God to waſh thy heart, and the heart of thy Seed. 'Tis not enough to have thy body waſhed, if thy heart and ſoul be not waſhed from its filth.</p>

               <p>Of the initiating Seal of thoſe times, we have formerly ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from <hi>Act.</hi> 7.8.</p>
               <p>That which next follows in the method propounded, is the legal Offerings, concerning which the Text lays down two Aſſertions or Points of Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:96313:121"/>1. That there was a divine Inſtitution and Command of God for the Offerings and Sacrifices that were under the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there were ſix kinds or ſorts of propitiatory Sacrifices under the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the Burnt offering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is the Scope of <hi>verſ.</hi> 37. The former Doctrine is the Scope of the 38: but that which is laſt mentioned in the words of the Text, is firſt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That there was a divine Inſtitution and Command of God for the Offerings and Sacrifices that were under the Law.</p>
               <p>The Text indeed ſpeaks properly of propitiatory Sacrifices: but there is a general truth in the Propoſition concerning all their Sacrifices, and all the ſorts and kinds of them.</p>
               <p>This Book of <hi>Leviticus</hi> begins thus, <hi>And he called</hi> Vaikra: that is, the Lord he called by an audible voice from his dwelling Place the Throne of his Glory, which was upon the Mercy Seat between the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> as he had promiſed <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.22. ſee <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.89. It is true, it is ſaid <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.22. concerning Burnt-Offerings or Sacrifices, that <hi>God commanded them not,</hi> &amp;c. But the ſenſe and meaning is comparative, though the Grammar of the words ſound as if it were negative. It cannot be explained better than the Old Note hath done it: ſhewing, that it was not his chief intent and purpoſe, that they ſhould offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, but that they ſhould regard wherefore they were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to wit, to be joyned to the word as Seals and Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Remiſſion of ſins in Chriſt; for without the word they were vain and unprofitable.</p>
               <p>To open this Doctrine a little to you, we muſt firſt conſider what a Sacrifice or an Offering is.</p>
               <p>Now an Offering in general, is any thing preſented to the Lord to become peculiarly his, and to be typical of Chriſt and Goſpel Myſteries.</p>
               <p>The former part of the Deſcription extends to Anti typical Offerings, as well as typical; to Goſpel, as well as legal Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: for our Souls and Bodies and all our Services are offered and preſented to the Lord, but not as Types and Shadows of another Goſpel; but they become his in a ſpiritual and peculiar
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96313:122"/>
propriety, as theirs of old did. Their Offerings by being offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed became the Lords, they preſenting, and the Lord accepting them: therefore they are called Holy, as being ſeparated to the Lord, ſeparated and ſet apart from common uſe to holy uſe.</p>
               <p>Hence they are called Gifts, <hi>Quorbanim,</hi> as being given to the Lord: <hi>â Quarab, appropinquavit:</hi> ſo in in the Text, their Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or their <hi>Corbans,</hi> ſee <hi>Mark</hi> 7.11.</p>
               <p>All this holds true of Goſpel Offerings under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but the Legal Offerings were ſet apart for God, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Chriſt and his great Sacrifice and Offering of himſelf up unto God for us: they all had ſome Relation to this, either as to the thing it ſelf, or the bleſſed Effects and Fruits of it.</p>
               <p>Some have diſtinguiſhed them into three ſorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as were offered at the Brazen Altar, or the Altar of Burnt-Offering: which repreſented the Death and Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as were offered in the Sanctuary, more near to the Holy of Holies, <hi>viz.</hi> the Shew-bread, and the Incenſe at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of Incenſe: which had reſpect to his Interceſſion for us at the Throne of Grace, in the virtue, and by the merit of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which he before had ſhed and offered up to the Juſtice of God for us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such as were offered in the Holy of Holies, where the High Prieſt came upon ſome extraordinary and ſpecial occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: which did repreſent the full attainment of the ends of both the former, namely, our full Acceſs unto, and Communion with God through the influence both of the Death and Oblation, as likewiſe of the Prayers and Interceſſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt for us.</p>
               <p>The two latter of theſe we ſhall ſpeak unto, when we come to thoſe parts of the Temple where theſe Services were to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: but the firſt ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sacrifices and Offerings at the Brazen Altar we are now to ſpeak unto.</p>
               <p>Theſe Sacrifices that were offered at the Brazen Altar, are commonly diſtributed into two ſorts: Propitiatory and Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtical; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or Sacrifices of Expiation and Sacrifices of Thankſgiving, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.22.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:96313:122"/>It is the former ſort whereof the Text ſpeaks; and they are here called <hi>Corbans,</hi> a Term which (as ſome affirm) is uſually appropriated to this ſort of Offerings, though the notation and original ſignification of it be more general.</p>
               <p>For the opening whereof unto you, I ſhall firſt give you a ſhort deſcription of them, and then annex ſome additional Rules for the further enlightning and illuſtration of them.</p>
               <p>And firſt you may ſee the nature of them in this ſhort deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: theſe propitiatory Sacrifices were Holy of Holineſſes, or Offerings moſt holy to the Lord, for attonement, or for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing of his Wrath by the deſtruction of the Sacrifice, to ſhadow forth the true atonement and expiation of ſin by the death of Jeſus, and our Reconciliation to, and Communion with God through him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they were Holy of Holineſſes, or Offerings moſt Holy to the Lord: it is the Phraſe which the Scripture uſeth concerning them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 2.3, 10. So are called in the Law thoſe ſacred things which ought not to be touched, and thoſe Meats whereof none were to eat, but only the conſecrated Prieſts in the holy Place, near the Altar. <hi>Deodat. in loc. quodeſh quodeſhim:</hi> only there is ſome limitation about the Peace-Offering, of which afterward.</p>
               <p>It is a diſtinction that doth occur in Lev. 21.22. <hi>He ſhall eat the bread of his God, both of the moſt holy, and of the holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The old Note is this, the moſt Holy, as of the Sacrifice for ſin: the Holy, as of the Tenths and Firſt Fruits.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Deodat.</hi> thus, moſt Holy] as were the Shew-Bread, the Meat-Offerings, the parts of Sin-Offerings, and Treſpaſs Offerings.</p>
               <p>[Holy] ſuch as were the Firſt Fruits, Tithes and Offerings of Thankſgiving.</p>
               <p>By Holy of Holineſſes, is meant moſt Holy: that Language elegantly expreſſing the ſuperlative Degree by ſuch a reduplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as King of Kings, Song of Songs, Heaven of Heavens, that is, the moſt excellent in their kind: ſo Holy of Holies, that is, moſt Holy.</p>
               <p>The other ſort are but Holy, or holineſs of Praiſes, <hi>quodeſh
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:96313:123"/>
hillulim:</hi> as the Phraſe is in Lev. 19.24. <hi>Ye ſhall count the Fruit thereof as uncircumciſed three years, but in the fourth year all the Fruit thereof ſhall be Holineſs of Praiſes to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ground of this double degree of Holineſs ſeems to be chiefly this: the more immediat and direct Relation they had to the Perſon, Actions, and Sufferings of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe legal things of old were: therefore theſe Sacrifices of Expiation, relating directly to the great work of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reconciliation unto God by the death of his Son, they were Holy of Holineſſes unto the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The end of them was attonement of their ſins, or appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the offended Juſtice of God: hence they are ſaid to have <hi>a ſweet ſmell, Lev.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. This is the Phraſe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Lecapper, to make atonement,</hi> applyed to Chriſt <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. and it is a Phraſe often uſed.</p>
               <p>Hence ariſeth the diſtinction of Sacrifices, from their ends and uſes; ſome being for Atonement, as theſe whereof we now ſpeak; and others for Thankſgiving, of which ſomething may be ſpoken hereafter if the Lord will.</p>
               <p>God is angry with Sinners, Juſtice is provoked and burns like Fire: therefore ſome ſatisfaction muſt be made, that Juſtice may be ſatisfied, and God atoned and reconciled to the Sinner.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This atonement was made by the death or deſtruction of the Sacrifice: this is the nature of all propitiatory Sacrifices, nothing can atone God, nothing can appeaſe offended Juſtice, but Death and Deſtruction. The Sacrifice muſt be deſtroyed, either in whole, or in part; and this was done by Fire.</p>
               <p>Hence they are called Fire-Offerings, or Offerings made by Fire: <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Ignitiones,</hi> Fireings: <hi>Oblatio ignita.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if they were living Creatures, they muſt be ſlain and killed: hence called <hi>Zebachim,</hi> in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as much as to ſay, a ſlaughtered Offering: in which ſenſe <hi>Zebach</hi> is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed unto <hi>Mincha,</hi> the former being of living Creatures, the latter of Meat and Drink: but in both there was a deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the thing ſacrificed, either by Fire, if it were of Inanimate things: or if it were a living Creature, both by Blood and Fire.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:96313:123"/>4. The end and deſign of all this, was to prefigure and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the death of Jeſus Chriſt, and our Reconciliation unto God thereby: for the Law had threatned Death for Sin, and <hi>the blood of</hi> Bulls <hi>and</hi> Goats <hi>could not take away ſin.</hi> Heb. 10.</p>
               <p>Some of the very <hi>Pagans</hi> have had ſo much glimmerings of Light, as to ſubſcribe to the Truth of this: and thence Satan triumphing over the fallen Sons of men, and abuſing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting their convictions, ſeduced them in the diſtreſs and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of their Conſciences, even to Sacrifice men to appeaſe their angry gods: wherein the acted upon this Principle, <hi>Quod pro vita hominis niſi vita hominis reddatur, non poſſe aliter Deorum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalium numen placari arbitrantur.</hi> as Caeſar <hi>de Bell. Gal. lib.</hi> 6. reports of the ancient <hi>Druids:</hi> they thought that unleſs the life of man were ſacrificed for his life, the Deity of the immortal Gods could not otherwiſe be appeaſed. <hi>Vid</hi> Lee Temple <hi>pag.</hi> 332. <hi>Homer</hi> alſo <hi>ibid.</hi> wherein the old <hi>Pagans</hi> had more Light than the Apoſtate <hi>Jews</hi> have at this day.</p>
               <p>Chriſt therefore is called <hi>a Sacrifice</hi> Epheſ. 5.2. 1 Cor. 5.7. <hi>Chriſt our Paſchal Lamb is ſacrificed for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as they refer directly unto Chriſt himſelf: ſo the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth us to apply them in a lower way to the Saints al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, whoſe ſouls and bodies and ſervices are living Sacrifices, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>with ſuch Sacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sacrifice of Chriſt doth <hi>placare Deum,</hi> appeaſe an incenſed God: our Sacrifices do but <hi>placere Deo,</hi> pleaſe an appeaſed God.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the Deſcription made good in theſe Four things put together, wherein you ſee the nature of theſe Legal Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Sacrifices, that they were Holy of Holineſſes, or Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings moſt Holy to the Lord, for atonement, or for the appeaſing of his Wrath by the deſtruction of the Sacrifice, to ſhadow forth the true atonement and expiation of ſin, by the death of Jeſus Chriſt: and ſo much for the nature of them, which was the firſt Enquiry. For further Rules of illuſtration which was the ſecond, take theſe Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1 That the Inſtitution of them, was preſently after the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:96313:124"/>
Sin and Fall of man: but the renewed Inſtitution and further Direction and Regulation of them, was by <hi>Moſes</hi> unto <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay the firſt Inſtitution of them, was preſently after the Sin and Fall of man: for there neither was, nor could be any uſe of them before.</p>
               <p>The firſt Intimation, (though ſomewhat obſcure) that we have of them, is in Gen. 3.21. <hi>the Lord made them Coats of Skins and cloathed them,</hi> but they could not wear the Skins until the Beaſts were ſlain: and ſlain they were (it is like) for Sacrifice, there being no need of them for Food at that time, nor any mention of the uſe of ſuch Food till <hi>Noahs</hi> time after the Flood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>But we read of Sacrifices more plainly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4. where <hi>Abel</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>brought an Offering to the Lord of the firſtlings of his Flock, and of the fat thereof,</hi> which, being a Godly man, he neither would nor durſt have done, had not the Lord appointed it: ſo likewiſe <hi>Noah</hi> Gen. 8.20, 21. <hi>builded an Altar unto the Lord, and took of every clean Beaſt, and of every clean Fowl, and offered Burnt Offerings on the Altar. And the Lord ſmelled a ſweet ſavour:</hi> ſo <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gods acceptance of <hi>Noahs</hi> Sacrifice, and before that of <hi>Abels,</hi> is a ſufficient proof and evidence of his having inſtituted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them: for <hi>Cultus non inſtitutus, non aeſt acceptus,</hi> Worſhip not commanded is not accepted.</p>
               <p>See likewiſe <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.25. and 18.12. where they were uſed among the <hi>Jews,</hi> before the giving of the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But from this ancient Inſtitution, with ſome further help from the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Heathen had a traditional dead knowledg of this Truth: but as they forgat and loſt the true Object to whom they ſhould have offered up their Sacrifices, ſo they had nothing but a dead form of Sacrifices, wholly perverted from their true and right end and uſe: therefore God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> reſtores and renews this great inſtitution; therefore the Text ſaith <hi>verſ. ult. This is the Law which the Lord commanded</hi> Moſes, <hi>in the day that he commanded the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to offer their Oblations unto the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Inſtitution was ſo corrupted, that there was need of ſome
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:96313:124"/>
renewed Light and Reformation about it: but being of ſo great Antiquity before there was any Tabernacle or Temple, or Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or Feſtivals appointed: therefore I put Offerings and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices before the reſt, the Inſtitution of them being much more ancient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. In this renewed Inſtitution and Regulation of their Offerings and Sacrifices, there were ſundry Adjuncts and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, ſome whereof were required, and ſome ſeverely forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be added to them, all which were myſtical and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. It may be truly ſaid of them which hath been falſly boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning humane Ceremonies, that they be neither dark nor dumb, but myſtical and ſignificant, and fit to ſtir up the dull mind of man to the remembrance of his duty towards God, by ſome ſpecial and notable ſignification, whereby he may be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. They had their ſpiritual ſignifications by Gods intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and appointment, (as indeed it is Gods prerogative to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point myſtical and ſignificant Ceremonies in his Worſhip.)</p>
               <p>That they had ſo, will appear in the Particulars, both <hi>ex na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura rei,</hi> from the very nature of the thing it ſelf, and by confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſundry other Scriptures, by the Light whereof, we muſt ſearch and find out the Interpretation.</p>
               <p>They may be interpreted and applyed (many of them) to the Church, in a ſecondary way, in regard of the union and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it hath with Chriſt, as well as unto Chriſt himſelf primarily and chiefly. The Adjuncts required and annexed to them were many, which will come to be ſpoken to, when we come to the ſeveral ſorts and kinds of Sacrifices: only ſome Generals may be now mentioned, deferring the explication of them, to the places where their Inſtitution is firſt mentioned. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were all tyed and appropriated by divine Inſtitution, <hi>to the Brazen Altar at the door of the Tabernacle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was a new addition in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Reformation: for they had Sacrifices (as hath been ſhewed) from the firſt Promiſe of the Goſpel, after the entrance of Sin: but there was no Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, nor one only Altar appointed and inſtituted, till <hi>Moſes</hi> his time.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:96313:125"/>2. Another appurtenance of all the Sacrifices was Salt, <hi>Levit.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.49. <hi>every Sacrifice is ſalted with Salt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Muſick, Temple Muſick both Vocal and Inſtrumental, whereof the former ſort indeed was Moral, but the latter, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial. While the Sacrifices were offering, the Trumpets were ſounding, and other muſical Inſtruments.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Incenſe. As ſoon as they had offered the Sacrifice, and the Muſick and Trumpets ceaſed, the Prieſt went into the Holy Place to offer Incenſe, and the people without prayed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Many ceremonious Actions, partly of the Sinner that brought the Sacrifice, but chiefly of the Prieſts and Levites in ordering and ſacrificing of it: and here (amongſt the reſt) the Ceremonies of Purification from legal and ceremonial Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may come to be conſidered: ſuch as theſe, were the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts required.</p>
               <p>The Adjuncts forbidden, were in general any conformity or complyance with the <hi>Pagans</hi> in their Rites and Ceremonies; Deut. 12.4, 30.31.32. <hi>Ye ſhall not do ſo unto the Lord your God What thing ſoever I command you, obſerve to do it: thou ſhalt not add thereto, nor diminiſh from it.</hi> ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.9, 10. complyance with Popiſh Worſhip is forbidden, under pain of Gods Wrath.</p>
               <p>Particularly two things were ſeverely interdicted and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in all their Sacrifices, (except ſome peculiar Caſes, of which afterwards) Leaven and Honey, <hi>Levit.</hi> 2.11. the myſteries of all which, we ſhall endeavour to open to you by the help of Chriſt, in our further progreſs upon this Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. The occaſions upon which they were to be offered, were of all ſorts; I ſhall but inſtance in four Heads of things. As,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Confer ſer. of the Burnt-Offering on <hi>Levit. 1.</hi>
                  </note>1. When under guilt of ſin; for this was the direct intent and ſcope of them all, they were to offer a Sacrifice for Reconciliation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the obtaining of any needful Mercy, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting and removing of any Judgment or Danger, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending or inflicted: as 1 Sam. 7.9, 10. Samuel <hi>offered a Lamb for a Burnt Offering,</hi> and it found great acceptance with God, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was fighting againſt the <hi>Philiſtins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:96313:125"/>So the <hi>Iſraelites Judg.</hi> 20.26. when ſeeking unto God by Faſting and Prayer, for Succeſs and Victory in their War againſt the <hi>Benjamites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>David</hi> to remove the Plague, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The neglect whereof in great Enterpriſes, hath ſometimes cauſed a good Cauſe to miſcarry, as <hi>Judges</hi> 20.26. this ſeems to have been one of the fatal Errors in their management of it the two former times: for we read not that they offered Sacrifice, till their third attempt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To teſtifie their Joy and Thankfulneſs for Mercies recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: as <hi>Noah</hi> when he came out of the <hi>Ark, Gen.</hi> 8.20. and <hi>Solomon</hi> when he had obtained Wiſdom, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the inſtituted ſeaſons of them; for beſides Vows and free Will-Offerings, upon ſuch emergencies of Providence as thoſe before mentioned, there were many Caſes wherein they were inſtituted and required: as when a Prieſt was to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, an unclean Perſon to be Purified, any Feſtival or Holy-day to be Celebrated: they had all their reſpective Sacrifices and Offerings appointed by the Law.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the nature of theſe Legal Sacrifices, as alſo the firſt Inſtitution, the adjuncts and occaſions of them.</p>
               <p>As to the ſeveral ſorts and kinds of them, the next Doctrine will inform you, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. That the Sacrifices of Propitiation under the Law, may be referred to theſe ſix kinds or ſorts: namely, the Burnt-Offering, the Meat Offering, the Sin Offering, the Treſpaſs-Offering, the Offering of Conſecrations, and the Sacrifice of the Peace-Offerings.</p>
               <p>They are, and may be ſeveral ways diſtinguiſhed and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted; but I ſhall content my ſelf at preſent with this diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Text, and ſhall ſpeak unto them (as the Lord ſhall enable me) in the order wherein the Text hath ſet them down before us, the Words whereof are a ſhort recapitulation of the general Heads of the ſeven firſt Chapters of this Book; all which treat upon theſe ſeveral ſorts of Sacrifices and Offerings, with the Rules and Rites appertaining to them; which, having been
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:96313:126"/>
delivered and laid down at large, the Text concludes and winds up all thus, <hi>This is the Law of the Burnt-Offering and of the Meat-Offering,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Wherein lay the difference between theſe ſeveral kinds and ſorts of Sacrifices?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There were ſome things wherein they all agreed, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in all thoſe general things before mentioned, in the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and explication of them. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were all offered at the Brazen Altar, and ſo were Offerings of a lower nature alſo. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe were all <hi>Quodeſh Quodeſhim</hi> moſt Holy, Holy of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They were all <hi>Iſhim,</hi> Offerings made by Fire.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They were all Propitiatory, they did ſerve for Expiation and Atonement: therefore they differed not in the general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or in the general ſcope and intent of them, which was the ſame in all; namely, to ſhadow forth Chriſt in his death, as the true Sacrifice for our ſins, and in other myſteries of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Grace and Love, in the Goſpel of our Salvation.</p>
               <p>But the difference conſiſts in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Partly in the different matter of them; as an <hi>Oxe</hi> or a <hi>Sheep</hi> in ſome, Flower and Wine in others of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Partly in the particular Ends and Deſigns and Occaſions of them; ſome being for ſins of Ignorance, as the Sin Offering: ſome for ſins againſt Knowledg, as Treſpaſs Offerings: ſome for Conſecration of the Prieſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Partly, yea principally in the different Ceremonies accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying them: ſome were cut in pieces, as <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Oxen:</hi> but ſome were only ſlit in the middle, but not cut aſunder, as Birds.</p>
               <p>And various other Ceremonies there were, as you will ſee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when we come to open and explain the ſeveral ſorts and kinds of Sacrifices. At preſent I ſhall conclude with two words of uſe, from all that hath been ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Let us learn this great Leſſon, to keep cloſe to the Rule of divine Inſtitution in matters of Worſhip.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you mark the Text, how emphatical the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:96313:126"/>
are, <hi>This is the Law of all the ſeveral ſorts of Sacrifices which the Lord commanded</hi> Moſes, <hi>when he commanded the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to offer their Oblations,</hi> &amp;c. As they did nothing but what the Lord commanded <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo we ſhould do nothing, but what Chriſt hath commanded us. Make that your great enquiry in all things, that concern the Worſhip of God; hath the Lord commanded it? Is the Command gone forth from Mount <hi>Sion</hi> for it, Yea or No? The Apoſtles were limited <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>ult.</hi> in their preaching, to teach only what Chriſt had commanded them; had they taught their own Inventions, they had exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Commiſſion; they had not been faithful to their Truſt; but they were faithful in teaching and tranſmitting to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, what the Lord himſelf had taught and commanded them: 1 Cor. 11.23. <hi>What I received of the Lord, that I delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that the Lord Jeſus the ſame night in which he was betrayed, took bread,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>When a Miniſter baptiſeth with the ſign of the Croſs, or any ſuch like ſuperſtition, he cannot ſay, I received this from the Lord. Practiſe nothing which the Word doth not require; omit nothing that the Word doth require, whatever worldly troubles or dangers you incurr.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. See the worth and value of the Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt, and the neceſſity of it for the Juſtification and Salvation of loſt Sinners. For what was the meaning of all theſe Offerings and Sacrifices whereof they had ſo great a multitude, and ſo many ſeveral ſorts and kinds of them under the Law, but to lead us by the hand to Jeſus Chriſt, to the true Sacrifice and Atonement that is in his death and blood: for <hi>he is the Propitiation for our ſins.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.2. This was the ſcope and deſign of them all; for it was impoſſible that ſuch Sacrifices ſhould do the work of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice, and reconciling God and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; therefore they were not to terminate their thoughts there, but to look beyond them to Jeſus Chriſt, in whom both we and they are reconciled to God. That this was the Scope of them, appears throughout the New Teſtament; therefore Chriſt is called <hi>a Sacrifice,</hi> Epheſ. 5.2. and <hi>a Propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:96313:127"/>And hence the Apoſtle ſo argues; Heb. 9.13, 14. <hi>If the blood of Bulls and Goats, and the aſhes of an Heiſer, ſprinkling the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh: how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf with out ſpot to God, purge your Conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God.</hi>

               <p>The end of it (as of the reſt) was atonement, reconciliation and remiſſion of ſin; Verſ. 9. <hi>a Savour of Reſt, or a ſweet Savour.</hi> For as a ſweet ſmell refreſheth and quieteth the Senſes: ſo Chriſts Oblation appeaſeth Gods Spirit, <hi>Ainſw. in loc.</hi> Hence is that Phraſe, Ezra 6.9, 10. <hi>Sacrifices of Reſt,</hi> or of ſweet Savours to the God of Heaven; ſo Epheſ. 5.2. <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf for us, an Offering, and a Sacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling Savour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Laws and Ordinances of the Burnt-Offering were either concerning the matter of it, or the actions to be performed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; which being different, according to the different matter
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:96313:128"/>
of it, will come in under the ſeveral ſorts of matter whereof the Sacrifice was to conſiſt, which was in general clean Creatures.</p>
               <p>This Rule was to be obſerved in all the Sacrifices; and it was very ancient; for we read of this diſtinction of Beaſts into clean and unclean, even in <hi>Noahs</hi> time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.2. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.20.</p>
               <p>There were two ſorts of cleanneſſes of the irrational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, clean for Sacrifice, and clean for Food.</p>
               <p>Of the cleanneſs for Food, we read in <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. which ſeems to have been then firſt appointed; for to the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> there is no ſuch reſtriction given, but a large and general Commiſſion to eat any wholeſome Fleſh. Gen. 9.3. <hi>Every moving thing that liveth, ſhall be Meat for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the cleanneſs and uncleanneſs for Sacrifice, ſeems to have been from the very firſt Inſtitution of Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>The Rule whereof in general is this, that there were no wild Beaſts or Fowls, no ravenous carnivorous Beaſts or Birds of prey allowed in Sacrifices, but ſuch as were of the milder ſort. The reaſon whereof, is thought to be partly from their Properties, being more harmleſs and innocent, more uſeful and profitable, and ſerviceable Creatures to mans uſe, and ſo fitteſt to ſignifie the like things in Chriſt, and in his people: and partly becauſe of mans peculiar poſſeſſion and propriety in them, being more fully in his power and poſſeſſion, than the wild Beaſts of the Field. Or if no reaſon for it could be aſſigned, we muſt acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in the ſupreme Authority of God, ſo ordaining and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: as why not a <hi>Hen,</hi> as well as a young <hi>Pidgeon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How abominable it was to tranſgreſs in the matter of their Sacrifices, you may ſee by thoſe expreſſions in Iſai. 66.3. <hi>He that killeth an Ox, is as if he ſlew a man: he that ſacrificeth a Lamb, as if he cut off a Dogs neck: he that offereth an Oblation, as if he offered Swines blood.</hi> In all which, the Lord expreſſeth the greateſt deteſtation by thoſe Reſemblances and Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>But in this the Heathen greatly corrupted themſelves; for as they forgat and loſt the true Object of Worſhip, offering their Sacrifices to Devils, and not unto God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20. So they
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:96313:128"/>
ſacrificed all ſorts of Creatures, without any difference of clean or unclean, even Swine, wherein the <hi>Jews</hi> alſo did corrupt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at leaſt ſo far as to the eating of it, as appears out of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65.4. yea, they proceeded ſo far as to Sacrifice men; <hi>their Sons and Daughters</hi> (an horrible thing) <hi>which the Lord command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, and which never came into his heart.</hi> Jer. 7.31. For as it was not poſſible that the blood of <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Goats</hi> ſhould take away ſin: ſo neither could the blood of man do it, but only of that man who is God alſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.</p>
               <p>The matter of the Burnt-Offering which was approved and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God, was of three ſorts: <hi>Of the Herd,</hi> that is, the bigger ſort of Cattel; and <hi>of the Flocks,</hi> that is, the leſſer ſort of Cattel, and <hi>of the Fowls:</hi> and ſo this Chapter divides it ſelf into theſe three parts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Burnt-Offering of the Herd, to <hi>verſ.</hi> 10.</item>
                  <item>2. The Burnt-Offering of the Flock, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. to <hi>verſ.</hi> 14.</item>
                  <item>3. The Burnt-Offering of Fowls, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. to the end.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The Burnt-Offering of the Herd; we may here conſider the matter of it, and the Actions to be performed about it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The matter of the Offering is a <hi>Bullock, a Male without blemiſh,</hi> verſ. 3. ſee this Law repeated and confirmed, <hi>Lev.</hi> 22.20, to 24. ſee <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.7, 8, 14. And being ſo vehemently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, we may well think it is not without ſome ſpecial myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: the Beſt and moſt Perfect, is fitteſt for ſo great a God.</p>
               <p>Moreover this did alſo figure and repreſent Jeſus Chriſt his perfection in himſelf, and ours in him. He was <hi>a Male, and without ſpot or blemiſh.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.19. a Sacrifice of abſolute puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and perfection.</p>
               <p>And the like expreſſions are uſed concerning Chriſt myſtical, in Epheſ. 5.27. <hi>without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, holy, and without blemiſh:</hi> we ſhall be ſo perfectly at that day. And in this life (in ſome degree) there is a perfection of ſincerity here; there is a blameleſs ſpotleſs Converſation.</p>
               <p>As the Burnt-Offerings of old: ſo ſhould we and all our Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Offerings to the Lord be. We ſhould ſerve him with the beſt we have, the beſt of our time and ſtrength, the vigor
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:96313:129"/>
of our ſpirits, the utmoſt improvement of all our abilities in his Service, and to his Glory: we ſhould ſacrifice all to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The actions to be performed about it: for the Lord was pleaſed to ordain and appoint ſundry myſtical and ſignificant Rites and Ceremonies, to be uſed about the Burnt-Offering, which were full of Teaching, and ſpiritual Myſtery.</p>
               <p>For what hath been vainly and falſly boaſted and arrogated to religious Ceremonies of mens deviſing, it is moſt true concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe divine Ceremonies: That they be neither dark nor dumb, but myſtical and ſignificant, and fit to ſtir up the dull mind of man to the remembrance of his Duty toward God, by ſome ſpecial and notable ſignification, whereby he may be edified.</p>
               <p>I ſhall enumerate them with ſome ſhort hints of Inſtruction from them, in nine Particulars, as they lie before us in the Text, which mentions at leaſt nine ceremonial Actions about the Burnt-Offering.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Offerer was to bring it to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, before the Lord.</item>
                  <item>2. Lay his hand upon it.</item>
                  <item>3. The Prieſt muſt kill it.</item>
                  <item>4. He muſt pour out the Blood and ſprinkle it round about.</item>
                  <item>5. Flay and cut it in pieces.</item>
                  <item>6. The Pieces to be ſalted.</item>
                  <item>7. The Leggs and Inwards waſhed.</item>
                  <item>8. All muſt be laid upon the Altar and burnt with Fire. And,</item>
                  <item>9. The Aſhes carried out of the Camp into a clean place.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The Offerer was <hi>to bring it to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, before the face of the Lord.</hi> verſ. 3. Great weight is laid upon this, <hi>Lev.</hi> 17.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.</p>
               <p>We may learn three or four things out of this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here was a voluntary act of the Offerer: for the Prieſt was not to go to him to fetch it, but the man himſelf is to bring it <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. of his own voluntary will: ſo Chriſt dyed willingly, and <hi>offered up himſelf a Sacrifice</hi> and a whole Burnt-Offering <hi>unto God for us,</hi> Epheſ. 5.2. Joh. 10.18. <hi>I lay down my life of my ſelf:</hi> ſo ſhould we in all our Services be a willing people; we ſhould come
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:96313:129"/>
before the Lord with willing minds, when we preſent our <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi> our Gifts, Services and Oblations to him: <hi>God loves a cheerful Giver,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This leads us by the hand, and points every way to Jeſus Chriſt as the cauſe of our acceptance with the Lord: in that they were to bring it to the door of the Tabernacle of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to be offered upon the Altar which ſtood there.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt is both the Door and the Tabernacle, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and the Prieſt: <hi>He is the door of the Sheep.</hi> Joh. 10.7. And he is <hi>the true Tabernacle and the Sanctuary which the Lord hath pitched, and not man.</hi> Heb. 8.2. <hi>A greater and more perfect Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle not made with hands.</hi> Heb. 9.11. And he is <hi>the Altar.</hi> Heb. 13.10. <hi>which ſanctifies the Gift,</hi> and makes it accepted; <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.19. And Chriſt is the Prieſt alſo, that preſents and offers up our Sacrifices to the Lord: He is often called a Prieſt, and our great High Prieſt.</p>
               <p>This therefore teacheth us, That all our acceſs unto, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation with the Lord, is only in and through Jeſus Chriſt: it is through him alone that our Services and Sacrifices are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: there is no acceptance out of Chriſt. For he that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected this, was <hi>to be cut off.</hi> Lev. 17.8, 9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are to bring it hither <hi>before the face of the Lord,</hi> or the preſence of the Lord: this refers to the holieſt of all, where God dwelt, and where his preſence did appear.</p>
               <p>So the meaning is, that we are to ſee God in all our Services, and to eye the preſence of God, and that he is to be ſeen there, and there only, even in and by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Luk. 1.75. <hi>that we might ſerve him before him</hi>— 2 Cor. 4.6. <hi>the Light of the Knowledg of the Glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Tabernacle was a Type of the Church, which is often called the Tabernacle and Temple and Houſe of God. We are to worſhip God in his Church, <hi>in the Aſſemblies of his people.</hi> Heb. 10.25. and 12.22, 23. So much for the firſt ceremonial Action about the Burnt-Offering.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Sinner that brought the Sacrifice, was <hi>to lay his hand upon the head of it.</hi> verſ. 4. this was not required in the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:96313:130"/>
of Fowls, but only of Beaſts, ſee the like <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.10</p>
               <p>There is ſome controverſy here, whether he was to lay on his right hand or his left hand, or both; but ſeeing it is in the ſingular Number, and ſeeing it is expreſly commanded <hi>that the Prieſt ſhould lay on both his hands,</hi> Lev. 16.21. that is, both for his own ſins and the peoples: therefore it is thought by ſome not improbably, that when any of the people offered, he laid on but one hand.</p>
               <p>But whether the right, or the left? We may ſuppoſe that whatſoever was not limited by God, was left at liberty. This Ceremony relates to the confeſſion of ſin, and the tranſlation of the guilt of it upon the Sacrifice: the Offerer in this Ceremony disburthening himſelf of ſin, and putting over his own Guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sacrifice; ſo it is explained Lev. 16.21. <hi>He ſhall lay on his hands, and confeſs over him the Iniquities of the Children of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Chriſt hath born our ſins, and carried our ſorrows.</hi> Iſa. 53.4, 5.</p>
               <p>And we are to confeſs our ſins over him by Faith in Chriſt; and through the blood of his Sacrifice, it ſhall be forgiven us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7, 9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Sacrifice muſt be <hi>killed and ſlain, and that upon the north ſide of the Altar.</hi> verſ. 5. and verſ. 11.</p>
               <p>It is queſtioned here, who did this; whether he that brought the Offering, or the Prieſt? But doubtleſs it was the Prieſt; for it is ſaid of him that kills the Offering, that <hi>he ſhall ſtay it.</hi> verſ. 5, 6. but that was the Prieſts work.</p>
               <p>And to the killing of the Sacrifice of Beaſts, anſwers <hi>the wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the head of ſacrificed Fowls.</hi> But this is expreſly affirmed to be the Prieſts work, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>Only this we find, that the Levites were added to the Prieſts to aſſiſt them, and help them in the whole work of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.19. and we find it often recorded that they did ſo, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.34. Therefore in <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. of that <hi>Chap.</hi> where the Killers and the Prieſts are diſtinguiſhed, it is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood concerning the people, as if they had killed the Offerings, but rather the Levites: ſee likewiſe 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.28, 31. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.10, 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:96313:130"/>So much for the literal explication of this Ceremony: now for the myſtery and meaning of it.</p>
               <p>What might be noted from hence, concerning actions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations properly and peculiarly miniſterial, we ſhall obſerve when we come to that place, to the legal Prieſthood and Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>But it is plain and obvious, that it holds forth the death of Chriſt, the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was ſlain and cut off, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.26. <hi>His Soul was made an Offering for ſin.</hi> Iſa. 53.10.</p>
               <p>As to that Circumſtance of <hi>killing it on the north ſide of the Altar.</hi> verſ. 11. the ſame Rule is given concerning the Sin-Offering, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.25. and the Treſpaſs Offering, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.1, 2.</p>
               <p>There be various applications of this.</p>
               <p>Some think there is no further myſtery in it, but that the Tabernacle door and the Altar were ſo ſituate and placed, that on the north ſide there was more ſpace for ſuch Acts as required moſt room, as the killing and dreſſing of the Sacrifices did: ſo our own Annotators.</p>
               <p>But others conceive this Law was not without ſomething of myſtery in it: ſome note how their greateſt Troubles and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were from the North; Jeremiah <hi>ſees a Seething Pot, and the face thereof was towards the North.</hi> Jer. 1.13. and then verſ. 14. <hi>Out of the North an Evil ſhall break forth upon all the Inhabitants of the Land.</hi> Therefore ſome conceive, that to reſtrain the Evils and Judgments of God, the Offerings were ſlain on the north ſide of the Altar: alſo that the ſituation of the Temple was on the north ſide of the City: Pſal. 48.2. <hi>Mount</hi> Sion <hi>on the ſides of the North.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover here is no regard had to the Sun, and to the Eaſt, but thither the Aſhes were carried forth, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. Whereas the Heathen were accuſtomed to Sacrifice, and to direct their Worſhip towards the Eaſt, and towards the Sun, which they made an Idol of. In oppoſition to which Idolatry, (as ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) the Lord appointed his people to ſacrifice towards the North.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, the Goſpel hath prevailed more in the northern Hemiſphere of the World, (which alſo is more inhabited) than in the Southern.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:96313:131"/>
                  <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in his Viſion of the holy City, doth firſt deſcribe <hi>the north Gates of the holy City reſtored:</hi> which ſome think is not without ſomething of myſtery, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48.1, 16, 30. <hi>Tydings out of the North.</hi> Dan. 11. that is (ſay ſome) the Reformation in theſe northern Countries, the Tydings whereof is evil News to Antichriſt, and the continual progreſs of that Work, hath been a continual trouble to him theſe hundred and fifty years.</p>
               <p>But I think we may acquieſce in what was firſt mentioned: <hi>Aynſworth</hi> hath this Note on <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.25. hereby was figured that Chriſt our Sin-Offering, ſhould be killed by the Prieſts in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> and Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> which was on the ſides of the North: Pſal. 48.2. <hi>Crucified on Mount</hi> Calvary, which was on the North-Weſt ſide of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> as by the <hi>Jews</hi> Tradition, the morning Sacrifice was killed at the North Weſt Horn of the Altar.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The blood muſt be poured forth at the foot of the Altar, and ſprinkled upon it round about.</hi> The former indeed is not expreſſed in this Chapter, but it is neceſſarily implyed, and you find it expreſſed <hi>Cap.</hi> 8.15. for we muſt borrow Light from other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; <hi>poured forth,</hi> Lev. 8.15. <hi>ſprinkled</hi> in this Chapter verſ. 5. <hi>it was poured forth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And almoſt all things in the Law were purged <hi>by blood:</hi> Heb. 9.22. <hi>and without ſhedding of blood there is no Remiſſion.</hi> This was a great myſtery; a Type of the blood of Chriſt; it leads us to the effuſion and application of the blood of Chriſt. Firſt the effuſion of it to the ſatisfaction of divine Juſtice; Iſai. 53.12. <hi>He hath poured out his Soul unto death.</hi> Mat. 26.28. <hi>my blood which is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt did often bleed for us in the day of his Humiliation, under the guilt of our ſins.</p>
               <p>As at his Circumciſion, then were the firſt drops of that pure and precious blood ſhed, that Sin-Expiating, that Soul-Saving blood: and in his Agony in the Garden, he did ſweat clodded blood: and when he was ſcourged, then he bled again for us: and when Crowned with Thornes, and in his Death and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion. And finally when they pierced his Side with the Spear, when that ſacred Blood and Water iſſued forth, which <hi>John</hi> ſaw
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:96313:131"/>
and bare record of. Joh. 19.34, 35. <hi>One of the Souldiers with a Spear pierced his Side, and forthwith there came out Blood and Water, and he that ſaw it bare record, and his record is true, and he knoweth that he ſaith true, that ye might believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus was the blood of the Sacrifice poured forth.</p>
               <p>And it was alſo <hi>ſprinkled:</hi> ſo is Chriſts blood, and therefore it is called Heb. 12.24. <hi>the blood of ſprinkling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sprinkling is a Ceremony very ſignificant of ſpiritual things; but where was this blood ſprinkled?</p>
               <p>The Text ſaith, <hi>It was ſprinkled upon the Altar round about.</hi> From this expreſſion, we may note the miſtake of ſuch as think the ſetting of the Communion-Table cloſe to the Wall like a Dreſſer or Side-Table, is to ſet it Altar-wiſe.</p>
               <p>For it is moſt clear and certain, that their Altars were ever ſo ſituate, as that they might be compaſſed round about.</p>
               <p>This expreſſion doth occur no leſs than twelve times in this book; of <hi>ſprinkling upon the Altar round about.</hi> ſo Pſal. 26.6. <hi>ſo will I compaſs thine Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to that conceit no other account can be given of it, but the profound ignorance of Papiſts and Prelates.</p>
               <p>Now the Altar was a Type of the Deity of Chriſt, as being that which ſupported and ſanctified the Sacrifice: Mat. 23.19. <hi>It is the Altar that ſanctifies the Gift.</hi> It was the Deity of Chriſt that gave that infinite value and virtue to his Sufferings: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look as the Altar was a Type of the divine nature of Jeſus Chriſt, and the blood was his Sufferings in the humane nature: ſo the pouring forth and ſprinkling this humane blood upon the divine Altar, may lead our thoughts to conſider the conjunction of the humane nature to the divine, and the influence of that Conjunction into all the Sufferings of the humane nature.</p>
               <p>Were not the Blood at the bottom of the Altar, and ſprinkled round about upon the Altar, it could have no merit, no value nor efficacy, it could have no Soul-Redeeming virtue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and acceptation with the Lord.</p>
               <p>But it is <hi>the blood of God.</hi> Act. 20.28. and therefore infinitely valuable and meritorious, the Offering being ſanctified by the Altar of his Deity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:96313:132"/>It was ſprinkled alſo upon the Book.</p>
               <p>The Scripture and Ordinances muſt be ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt, if ever they be made effectual to us for our good.</p>
               <p>And upon the people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19, 20, 21.</p>
               <p>This ſhews the application of it to our Souls and Conſciences, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.15.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth ceremonial Action about the Burnt-Offering was this, <hi>the Prieſt is to flay it and cut it into its pieces.</hi> verſ. 6. The Skin muſt be taken off, and the Body of the Sacrifice muſt be cut aſunder, yet not meerly chopt in pieces and mangled, but according to the ſeveral joynts and pieces of the Body: for God will have order in the things of his Worſhip. The Skin was the Prieſts Portion, ſee <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.8.</p>
               <p>As to the myſtery of this, I would not make too curious an application of it: but there be four things we may obſerve and learn out of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It related in general to the Sufferings of Chriſt, for great Sufferings are ſet forth by ſuch expreſſions: Micah 3. 2, 3. <hi>Who hate the good and love the evil, who pluck off their Skin from off them, and their Fleſh from off their Bones: who alſo eat the Fleſh of my people, and flay their Skin from off them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.15, 16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Something we may note here as to ſpiritual cloathing: Skins were firſt uſed for Apparrel, <hi>God clothed</hi> Adam <hi>with Skins.</hi> Gen. 3.21.</p>
               <p>And much of our Clothing at this day, is either the Skins of Beaſts, or the Hair and Wooll taken from thoſe Skins: as the Sacrifice being dead and ſlain, did leave a Skin for clothing to the Prieſt by whoſe hand he died: ſo Jeſus Chriſt our true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, who was <hi>led as a Sheep to the ſlaughter</hi> for our ſins, yet being dead, leaves a Garment of Righteouſneſs to cloth Believers with: therefore we are ſaid to put on Chriſt as a Garment.</p>
               <p>Rom. 13.14. <hi>Put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> got the Bleſſing, having his hand and his neck covered with Goat-Skins, and being clothed in the Garments of his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother.</p>
               <p>So Believers are bleſſed of God, being clothed with the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:96313:132"/>3. Whereas the Sacrifice in this Action was laid open, and the inward parts of it diſcovered to open view: ſo is Jeſus Chriſt fully and openly diſcovered in the preaching of the Goſpel; Gal. 3.1. <hi>before whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified among you,</hi> like a Sacrifice that is flayed and cut aſunder.</p>
               <p>Moreover God ſees the inward part of every Service, of every Sacrifice we preſent unto him.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God ſearcheth the heart, as the ſacrificeing Knife did the bowels of the Beaſt: there is no Skin, no cloke of Hypocriſy that can hide thee from the Lord.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Skin of the Sacrifice went to the Prieſt: it was part of his Maintenance; ſee Cap. 7. 8. <hi>and the Prieſt that offereth any mans Burnt Offering, even the Prieſt ſhall have to himſelf, the Skin of the Burnt Offering, which he hath offered.</hi> As before the Law the Sacrificer had the Skin, he enjoyed the benefit of that, either to cloth him, as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> Gen. 3.21. <hi>the Lord God made them Coats of Skins, and clothed them.</hi> Or to buy cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with, or what elſe he needed. And under the Law there was hardly any Sacrifice, of which the Prieſt had not his part.</p>
               <p>It teacheth us that <hi>they that ſerve at the Altar, ſhould live of the Altar.</hi> 1 Cor. 9.13, 14. from whence the Apoſtle argues to the care that ſhould be taken for the maintainance of Miniſters under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>So much for the fifth Ceremony about the Burnt-Offering, namely, the flaying it and cuting it in pieces.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The Pieces were to be ſalted.</hi> This indeed is not expreſſed in <hi>Cap:</hi> 1. but you will find it in other places: for as I ſaid at firſt, we muſt borrow Light from other Scriptures: Lev. 2.13. <hi>Every Oblation of thy Meat-Offering ſhalt thou ſeaſon with Salt, neither ſhalt thou ſuffer the Salt of the Covenant of thy God to be lacking.</hi> Ezek. 43.24. <hi>the Prieſts ſhall caſt Salt upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Rule is general to all Sacrifices, as well Burnt, as Meat-Offerings:
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:96313:133"/>
Mark 9.49. <hi>every Sacrifice ſhall be ſalted with Salt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I find by conference with other Scriptures, a twofold Myſtery hinted and aimed at in this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Salt doth preſerve things, and keep them from putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: this therefore ſignifies and ſhadows forth the Perpetuity of the Covenant of Grace. Hence is that emphatical expreſſion in the Text, Lev. 2.13. <hi>the Salt of the Covenant of thy God.</hi> So Salt is uſed Numb. 18.19. <hi>It is a Covenant of Salt for ever before the Lord unto thee, and to thy Seed with thee:</hi> that is, ſaith the Margin, ſure, ſtable and incorruptible. So 2 Chron. 13.5. <hi>Ought ye not to know, that the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>gave the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom over</hi> Iſrael <hi>to</hi> David <hi>for ever, even to him and to his Sons by a Covenant of Salt?</hi> that is, Perpetual, becauſe the thing that is ſalted is preſerved from Corruption, ſaith the <hi>Geneva</hi> Note upon the place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Salt makes things ſavoury and wholeſome, which without Salt would ſtink and putrify: Col. 4.6. <hi>let your Speech be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with Salt.</hi> That is, contrary to that corrupt Communication <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.29. wiſe and ſavoury and gracious Speech, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.49, 50. when there is no Salt, no Savour in a mans words, his Speech ſtinks and is corrupt: the Sacrifice is unſalted, and ſo it ſtinks.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>The Leggs and Inwards muſt be waſhed,</hi> Verſ. 12. the Feet and the Inwards are the fowleſt part of a Beaſt: waſhing away the filth, ſignifies ſpiritual waſhing and cleanſing.</p>
               <p>So the bodies of Believers are ſaid to be <hi>waſhed with pure Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and their hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience.</hi> Heb. 10.22. they are made clean both within and without, and their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs waſht away through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>The ſeveral parts of the Offering muſt be laid upon the Altar and burnt with Fire, till it be conſumed and burnt to aſhes.</hi> Seeing the Fire which once fell from Heaven, <hi>Lev.</hi> 9.24. was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually kept and preſerved upon the Altar, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.12. and the uſe of all other Fire forbidden in Sacrifices, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.1. putting of Fire upon the Altar in this place, can ſignifie nothing but kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, <hi>Deodat.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.7. See <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.9. <hi>the Fire burnt all night.</hi> The Wrath of God is the Fire, and Sin the Wood or Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el that feeds it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:96313:133"/>This is the Fire of the Juſtice and Wrath of God from Heaven, which ſeized upon Chriſt; and every part of him (as all the parts of the Offering) was burnt; his Head crowned with Thornes, his Side pierced with the Spear, his Hands and Feet with Nails, his whole body did ſweat drops of Blood, yea his Soul was heavy unto the Death, yea burnt to Aſhes as it were, brought to the utmoſt extremity of miſery: his Saints alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the <hi>fiery tryal,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.12.</p>
               <p>Though theirs is not a fire of Expiation, as Chriſts was, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. but only a fire of Purgation which they paſs through in this Life, to prepare and fit them for Heaven: but after this Life, there is no Purgatory as the Papiſts dream.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>The Aſhes muſt be carried out of the Camp into a clean place.</hi> Lev. 6.10, 11.</p>
               <p>The contrary is ſaid of the Rubbiſh of a leprous houſe, that <hi>the duſt and ſtones thereof, ſhould be poured forth into an unclean place.</hi> Lev. 14.40, 41. For they came from a polluted houſe.</p>
               <p>But theſe from the Lords holy dwelling place, and were the Reliques of an holy thing which the Lord here manifeſts that he hath a ſpecial regard of.</p>
               <p>This Ceremony is applied by the Apoſtle to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.11, 12, 13. Look as the Aſhes of the Sacrifice being burnt, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the dead Body of Chriſt: ſo the carrying of the Aſhes out of the Camp, ſignified how his crucified Body ſhould not be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried within the City, but carried into a clean place, into <hi>a new Sepulchre where never any man lay before.</hi> Joh. 19.41.</p>
               <p>So the dead Bodies of all his Saints, when they are ſpent and conſumed to Aſhes, they are regarded and preſerved in the duſt by God, as ſacred Reliques; and he will raiſe them up again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternal Life.</p>
               <p>So much for the Burnt Offering of the Herd, and the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies appertaining to it.</p>
               <p>There were alſo ſome other Actions about it, as that in Pſal. 118.27. <hi>of binding the Sacrifice with Cords, even unto the Horns of the Altar.</hi> But this, as it is not mentioned in this Chapter; ſo it ſeems rather to be an Action of natural neceſſity unto ſuch a
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:96313:134"/>
work, as the ſlaying of a Beaſt, then to have any ſpecial myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in it. Therefore let this ſuffice for the Burnt-Offering of the greater ſort of Cattel.</p>
               <p>Now the other two ſorts that follow, are the Burnt-Offering <hi>of the Flock,</hi> that is leſſer Cattel, <hi>Sheep or Goats.</hi> verſ. 10. And <hi>of Fowls,</hi> viz. <hi>Turtle Doves, and young Pigeons.</hi> verſ. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why the Lord appointed theſe leſſer Sacrifices?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> He did it, that ſo none might be able to plead excuſe to be exempted from his ſervice: for you know men are very apt to make excuſes.</p>
               <p>If the Lord had only appointed Oxen and Sheep, ſome might have pretended Poverty, and have ſaid, we would offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice but we are not able. Therefore theſe leſſer Sacrifices were ordained, that ſo both Rich and Poor might ſerve the Lord: ſo that here is no room left for any excuſe. If they cannot bring an Ox, the Lord will accept a couple of Turtle Doves, or young Pigeons: the Lord accepteth theſe ſmaller Sacrifices from the Poor, as well as greater from the Richer ſort of people. See Verſ. 17. <hi>it is of a ſweet ſavour to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Offering was brought by the Parents of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.24.</p>
               <p>As to the building of the Tabernacle, <hi>he that could not offer Gold or Silk or Purple, might bring Goats hair.</hi> Exod. 35.5, 6. Therefore let not poor people be diſcouraged; alas, I have no Eſtate, I have no Parts nor Learning, it may be ſo: but God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of mean ſervices, where there is but mean ability. <hi>For if there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi> 2 Cor. 8.12.</p>
               <p>I might add, that the Burthen is much eaſier under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: God doth not put us upon ſuch coſtly ſervice, ſuch a charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Religion as theirs was under the Law, eſpecially in theſe latter days. There is not a Servant in a Family, but may be able to buy a Bible, and ſo to read the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Now for the Particulars; they were of two ſorts, leſſer Cattel, and Fowls.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Offering of the leſſer ſort of Cattel, there is
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:96313:134"/>
nothing peculiar in the Rites and Ceremonies thereof, ſave only that of killing it at the north ſide of the Altar, which belongs indeed to other Sacrifices alſo; and was therefore ſpoken to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, upon the Burnt-Offering of the bigger ſort of Cattel.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt part of the Chapter is, concerning the Burnt-Offering of Birds or Fowls, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, to the end.</p>
               <p>We are to note here what Birds they were, and what were the ceremonial Actions about them.</p>
               <p>The Birds were not <hi>Ravens</hi> and <hi>Vultures</hi> and ſuch like; but <hi>Doves</hi> and <hi>Pigeons</hi> and <hi>Sparrows,</hi> at leaſt in that peculiar caſe of the Leproſy, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dove</hi> is often commended in the Scripture, for innocency and harmleſneſs; Mat. 10.16. <hi>Be ye wiſe as Serpents, and harmleſs as</hi> Doves. <hi>The Spirit appeared as a</hi> Dove. Mat. 3.16. So are the Saints; Pſal. 74.19. <hi>deliver not the Soul of thy</hi> Turtle Dove— and often in the Song of <hi>Solomon, my Love, my Dove</hi>— all the practical application I ſhall make of it, ſhall be this; Believers themſelves are living Sacrifices unto God: but if thy Sacrifice be accepted, thou muſt be a <hi>Dove,</hi> not a Bird of prey, but harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as <hi>Doves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ceremonious Actions about them, aim at the ſame gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſcope with the ceremonious Actions about the Burnt-Offering of Cattel, whereof we ſpoke before, and divers of them are the ſame.</p>
               <p>There be only three differing Ceremonies in the Burnt Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Fowls, whereof we are now to ſpeak.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>the Prieſt ſhall wring off his head,</hi> verſ. 15. which the old <hi>Geneva</hi> Note explains thus—</p>
               <p>The Hebrew word ſignifies to pinch off with the Nail, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ungue ſecuit.</hi> It occureth only here, and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.8. where the ſame Rule is given concerning the Treſpaſs-Offering.</p>
               <p>The Rule concerning the Burnt-Offering of Cattel, is only to kill them; that is, with the ſacrificing Knife to cut the Throat, and ſo let out the life and blood of the Beaſt, and then cut off the head, and cut all the parts aſunder, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 8.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this difference in the outward Ceremony, ſeems
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:96313:135"/>
to be from the different matter of the Sacrifice: both aiming at the ſame general ſcope, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhadow forth the Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, and the violence done to him for and by our ſins. For as the blood of the <hi>Turtle Dove</hi> was wrung out with violence: ſo was the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, when he made his Soul an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for ſin.</p>
               <p>Some note further, that the Head was not to be quite wrung off, as the parts were not to be divided aſunder; of which by and by.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Prieſt was to pluck away his Crop, with his Feathers, and caſt it beſide the Altar, on the eaſt part by the place of the Aſhes.</hi> verſ. 16.</p>
               <p>Why to the Eaſt? they had a place on the eaſt ſide of the Court, to which they carried forth the Aſhes.</p>
               <p>Becauſe this was the furtheſt off from the Holy of Holies: for the Temple ſtood directly Weſt, as you may ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.16. which the Lord did in oppoſition to the common Idolatry of thoſe times, which were wont to worſhip towards the Eaſt. There was therefore a place eaſtward from the Tabernacle where they threw the filth of the Sacrifices, as in reverence of the Divine Majeſty, as far as might be from the Ark of the Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>We muſt abandon whatſoever is unclean, when we come into Gods preſence; all filthineſs muſt be removed far away out of his ſight. As we come to an holy God in an holy duty; ſo we ſhould come in an holy manner, and with holy hearts: <hi>I will waſh mine hands in innocency, and ſo will I compaſs thine Altar, O Lord.</hi> Pſal. 26.6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He ſhall cleave it with the wings, but ſhall not divide aſunder.</hi> verſ. 17— <hi>cleave it,</hi> that is, long ways: ſo as there was a Wing on each ſide. This Ceremony of not dividing the Fowls, was very ancient: for <hi>Abraham</hi> uſed it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.10.</p>
               <p>And in reference to the ſame Scope, it was, that the Head and Body were not quite diſjoyned, but only the Neck pinched with the Prieſts Nail.</p>
               <p>Now what is there in Chriſt the Anti-type, that may anſwer this? <hi>Not a bone was broken.</hi> Joh. 19.33, 36.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:96313:135"/>Moreover the divine and humane nature were never totally ſeparated, notwithſtanding all his Sufferings, though his Soul was ſeparated from his Body; yet neither Soul nor Body was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Son of God, but incomprehenſibly and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fably united, when in the Grave, and in the duſt of Death.</p>
               <p>His Deity as the Head or principal Part, was not divided from his humane nature: nor was he who is the Head of his Church, divided from his myſtical Body by all his Sufferings; but remains indiſſolubly and everlaſtingly united to them.</p>
               <p>So much for the explication of the Burnt-Offering, whether of the Herd, or Flock, or Fowls, with the Ceremonies appertaining to them: now for the uſe of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. See here the difference between Gods Ceremonies, and mens; between religious Ceremonies of divine Inſtitution, and of humane Invention.</p>
               <p>Divine Ceremonies are full of Light, full of Spirit, full of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Marrow and Myſtery.</p>
               <p>But humane Ceremonies in the Worſhip of God, are full of Darkneſs and Vanity, thick Darkneſs, there is no Light, no ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in them: as men cannot bleſs their own Ceremonies, and make them effectual for ſpiritual ends: ſo they cannot ſo much as make them ſuitable and ſignificant; they are commonly ſo fooliſh, ſo impertinent and ridiculous, that it is hardly ſit to name them in a Pulpit, leſt they provoke laughter.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance; for I will give you an inſtance or two, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is an holy ſcorn, and an holy laughter.</p>
               <p>A man muſt wear a white Garment in a ridiculous manner like a Shift on the top of his Cloths, to ſignifie Purity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: a man muſt bow down like a fool to a thing made of Wood or Stone, call it a Crucifix, or an Altar, or what you pleaſe; to ſignifie I know not what, unleſs it be that they are Imps of Antichriſt, and in heart members of his pretended Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy that do ſuch things.</p>
               <p>But I hope you ſee, that it is not thus with Gods Ceremonies. If the Lord <hi>open our eyes, we may ſee wondrous things out of his Law.</hi> Pſal. 119.18.</p>

               <p>THis is mentioned in the ſecond place in that Enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Legal-Offerings, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.37. and treated of in the ſecond Chapter of this Book, next after the Burnt-Offering; and therefore comes now to be ſpoken of out of this Chapter, with help and conference of other Scriptures.</p>
               <p>It is called in Hebrew <hi>Mincha;</hi> concerning the notation or ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology of which word, which may give ſome light to the ſenſe of it, there be divers Conjectures.</p>
               <p>Some derive it from <hi>Nachah,</hi> to bring or Offer; hence <hi>Mincha, munus:</hi> in like manner as <hi>Mizvoh, praeceptum;</hi> from <hi>Zivah, praecepit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though the <hi>Rabbins</hi> read the Plural Number <hi>Menachoth,</hi> whence ſome derive it from a feigned Root <hi>Manach,</hi> that ſo <hi>[Mem]</hi> may be a radical letter; yet the Plural Number is read <hi>Minchoth</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.3.</p>
               <p>It is uſed in Scripture in three ſenſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is often uſed generally for any thing gift or Preſent,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:96313:137"/>
whether to God or men: which confirms the Etymology before given, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.13, 20— <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.11— 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is uſed not only for Gifts or Preſents to men, but for all ſorts of Offerings to God: even ſuch Sacrifices wherein Beaſts were ſlain, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4. where <hi>Abels</hi> Sacrifice of the Firſtlings of his Flock, is called his <hi>Mincha:</hi> ſo it agrees with <hi>Qorban,</hi> and is of as large extent in ſignification.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is frequently uſed in a narrower ſenſe for an Offering of the Fruits of the Earth, as contra diſtinguiſhed unto Sacrifices of living creatures. So <hi>Qorban</hi> is the general, and <hi>Mincha</hi> a ſpecies of <hi>Qorban:</hi> ſo in this place <hi>Lev.</hi> 2. <hi>Qorban Mincha,</hi> and in many other Scriptures.</p>
               <p>All propitiatory Sacrifices being referred in Scripture unto theſe two Heads, <hi>Zebach</hi> and <hi>Mincha:</hi> as <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.6— <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6. which the Apoſtle renders <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. that is, ſlain Sacrifices of living Creatures, which were offered both by Fire and Slaughter; which are called <hi>Zebach</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>hoſtia victima ſacrificium mactatum:</hi> and Offerings of Meat and Drink called <hi>Mincha, munus ſacrum frumentaceum libum, libamen:</hi> which being not living Creatures could not be ſlain, but were offered only by Fire and pouring forth.</p>
               <p>Our Tranſlators render it, (and not unfitly) the Meat Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; from the matter whereof it conſiſted, and from the Rite and manner of Offering, the greateſt part of it being to be eaten for Meat.</p>
               <p>Now concerning this <hi>Mincha</hi> or Meat-Offering, there be theſe ſix things to be enquired into.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Materials of it, which were Corn, Oyl, Frankincenſe and Salt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Actions to be performed about it; it was to be brought to the Prieſt, the Memorial of it burnt upon the Altar, and the Reſidue eaten by the Prieſt in the holy place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The meaning and ſignification of it; to be a ſweet Savour before the Lord.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Additions prohibited to be annexed to it, which were two, Leaven and Honey.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:96313:138"/>5. The Appurtenance of Drink-Offerings by divine Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on added to it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſeveral Seaſons and Occaſions on which the Meat-Offering was to be offered.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſix things we ſhall enquire into, (the Lord enabling us) chiefly out of this Chapter, and partly alſo out of other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, eſpecially in the two laſt Enquiries, which are not expreſly ſpoken to in this Chapter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Materials of it, they were theſe four, Corn, Oyl, Frankincenſe, and Salt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Bread Corn, Wheat or Barley,</hi> 1 Chron. 21.23. <hi>Wheat for the Meat Offering.</hi> See alſo Ezek. 45.13, 15. where <hi>Wheat and Barley</hi> are mentioned for the Meat-Offering.</p>
               <p>This was dreſſed and ordered ſeveral ways.</p>
               <p>They might offer the Meat-Offering of Wheat.</p>
               <p>Either only <hi>ground and ſifted into Flower,</hi> without any further preparation, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Soleth, ſimila,</hi> the Flower of Wheat; or <hi>dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and cooked into Cakes and Wafers</hi> verſ. 4. Or <hi>baked.</hi> verſ. 5.6. Or <hi>fryed in a frying Pan.</hi> verſ. 7. Or <hi>Firſt Fruits;</hi> not ſo much as grinding it into Meal or Flower, only <hi>dryed and beaten.</hi> verſ. 14.</p>
               <p>This Meat-Offering of Firſt Fruits was of Barley, becauſe that was firſt ripe in that Country: therefore the name of the firſt Month in the Year was called <hi>Abib,</hi> Exod. 13.4. <hi>quaſi menſis ſpicarum,</hi> the Month of Ears of Corn.</p>
               <p>Out of all which Corn-matter of the Meat-Offering, I ſhall mark three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It muſt be fine Flower, purged from the Bran.</p>
               <p>It ſhews the pure eſtate of Chriſt, and of all Chriſtians, with their ſervices in him, being purged as it were from the Bran of natural Corruption; <hi>Aynſw. in loc. Iſai.</hi> 66.20. it appears their manner was to bring them in a clean Veſſel.</p>
               <p>We ſhould labour in all our Offerings and Sacrifices to be pure and clean in his ſight, and to come with purged and refined Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. God muſt have the beſt, as the Flower muſt be fine and not courſe: ſo in the Burnt-Offering the Beaſts were to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh: and whatſoever they offered to God muſt be of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:96313:138"/>
the beſt, all betokening the purity and perfection of him, of whom they were Types, to wit, Jeſus Chriſt, and beſeeming the excellency of him to whom they were offered: <hi>Engl. Annot. on Numb.</hi> 28. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There was a Meat-Offering of Firſt Fruits; what this is, the Apoſtle informs us 1 Cor. 15.20. <hi>Chriſt is the Firſt Fruits by whom the whole Lump is ſanctified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There may be alſo ſome further accommodations of it, whereof we may ſpeak further, when we come to the Feaſt of Firſt Fruits.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It muſt be ground, ſifted, baked, fryed, beaten, and the like; ſome ſuch bruiſing and contuſion of it there muſt be.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Chriſt was bruiſed for our Iniquities, and beaten with ſtripes for our ſins.</hi> Iſai. 53.5. wherein his Members are partakers with him. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſweetly and ſpiritually, when he was to ſuffer Martyrdom by being devoured of wild Beaſts, he ſpeaks how his body was the Lords Corn, and muſt be ground by the Teeth of the wild Beaſts, to be prepared for the Lord: as in the Meat-Offering, the Corn was to paſs under ſome ſuch preparation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Ingredient in the Meat-Offering, was <hi>Oyl. verſ.</hi> 1, 4, 5, 7, 15. The quantity of Oyl is not expreſſed, but the meaning was, there ſhould be a <hi>quantum ſufficit,</hi> a fit propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it mingled with the Flower.</p>
               <p>Much uſe of Oyl there was under the Law, and ſo we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak further to it.</p>
               <p>It ſignified in general, the Spirit of God in the graces and comforts of it; <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.1. which Jeſus Chriſt did receive above meaſure, and from him all Believers in ſome degree, do partake of his anointing. There is and muſt be this ſacred Oyl in all our Offerings, the influence of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Frankincenſe.</hi> The uſe of this was to make a ſweet perfume in the Air, when the burning of the other things might have cauſed an ill ſcent.</p>
               <p>It figured the acceptableneſs unto God of the perſons and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of his people, through the mediation and interceſſion of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: he is ſet forth by <hi>Pillars of ſmoke, perfumed with Myrrhe
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:96313:139"/>
and Frankincenſe, with all Powders of the Merchant.</hi> Cant. 3.6. and without him our Offerings are not acceptable, nor our Sacrifices ſweet unto God. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.20. Hence there was no Oyl nor Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe in the Sin-Offering, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.11. nor in the Jealouſy-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.15. becauſe though it was for a Memorial, yet it was not to bring the perſon or his ſervices to remembrance with acceptance before God, but to bring his ſin to remembrance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Salt.</hi> Verſ. 13. which being required in all their Offerings, and ſo in the Burnt-Offering, there we ſpoke to it, and ſhewed that it was to teach them the perpetuity of the Covenant of Grace that God had made with them: and the wholeſome and ſavoury carriage and walking of his people.</p>
               <p>Now put all this together, and it ſpells thus much: That our Meat Offerings, our good Works being anointed with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and perfumed with the Incenſe of Chriſts Mediation, are accepted of God, and that in a Covenant of Salt, through the unchangeable faithfulneſs of God in the Covenant.</p>
               <p>So much for the Materials of the Meat-Offering, Corn, Oyl, Frankincenſe, and Salt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Actions to be performed about it, and they were three, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It muſt be brought to the Prieſt.</item>
                  <item>2. He is to burn a part of it, the memorial of it before the Lord.</item>
                  <item>3. The remnant of it muſt be eaten by the Prieſt.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. They were to <hi>bring it to the Sons of</hi> Aaron <hi>the Prieſts,</hi> verſ. 2. There was the ſame Action before in the Burnt-Offering, and there we ſhewed the meaning of it, that it imports a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary act of the Offerer, and a making uſe of Chriſt for accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in all our ſervices and approaches unto God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Prieſt is to burn the memorial of it upon the Altar, before the Lord.</hi> verſ. 2, 9, and 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[For a memorial]</hi> This (as Interpreters well obſerve) is ſpoken after the manner of men, to put God in remembrance of the perſon, or rather of his own love to him, and Covenant with him in Jeſus Chriſt. Pſal. 20.3. <hi>The Lord remember all thy Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and accept thy Burnt-Sacrifice</hi>— Act. 10.4. <hi>Thy Prayers and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:96313:139"/>
thine Almes are come up for a memorial before God.</hi> Hence <hi>Nehemiah</hi> prays <hi>Remember me, O my God, concerning this.</hi> Neh. 13.14, 22. the meaning is, that the Smoke thereof was to come up before God with acceptance; therefore there was Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe burnt with it, to make a ſweet ſmell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Remnant was</hi> Aarons <hi>and his Sons.</hi> verſ. 3. and again verſ. 10. that is, <hi>to eat it in the Sanctuary.</hi> ſee Lev. 6.16, 18. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Meat Offering of the Prieſts which might not be eaten, but was to be all burnt for a whole Burnt-Offering. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>This may be applied two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the Communion and Participation of Chriſt, by all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; <hi>For they are all Prieſts unto God.</hi> Rev. 1.6. <hi>A Royal Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>An holy Prieſthood to offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices.</hi> And Chriſt is our Meat-Offering, he is the Bread of God, <hi>the bread of life.</hi> Joh. 6.33. So then the Prieſts eating the Meat-Offering, is Believers feeding upon Chriſt by Faith.</p>
               <p>As the Meat-Offering was partly burnt upon the Altar, and partly eaten by the Prieſts: ſo Jeſus Chriſt, having offered up himſelf once for all, doth always continue a ſpiritual Meat-Offering, and Food for the hungry Souls of all Believers to feed upon. <hi>His fleſh is meat indeed, his blood is drink indeed.</hi> Joh. 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This was part of the Prieſts maintenance.</hi> As indeed they had ſomething out of every Offering, ſee <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.9, 10.</p>
               <p>From whence we ſee, that they who ſerve at the Altar, ſhould live of the Altar; they that preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The third thing concerning the Meat-Offering, is the ſcope and intent of it: this is hinted in <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>To be an Offering made by Fire of a ſweet ſavour unto the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More particularly, there was a fourfold Myſtery ſhadowed forth by it; I ſpeak now as to the general ſcope of the whole: for the myſteries of particular Rites and Ceremonies about it, muſt be ſpoken to under each particular Rite.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It did prefigure and ſhadow forth the atonement or expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin, by the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, both by his Sufferings and Actings, his active and paſſive Obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:96313:140"/>That this was one part of the myſtery of the Meat-Offering, the Scripture is expreſs: 1 Sam. 3.14. <hi>the iniquitie of</hi> Elies <hi>houſe ſhall not be purged or expiated</hi>

                  <hi>with Sacrifice, or Offering for ever.</hi> Neither by ſlain Sacrifices, nor by Meat Offerings for ever; ſo 1 Sam. 26.19. <hi>if the Lord have ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thee up againſt me, let him accept a</hi> Mincha. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6. ſpeaking of propitiatory Sacrifices, he ſaith <hi>Zebach</hi> and <hi>Mincha; ſlain Sacrifices and Meat-Offerings thou wouldſt not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle applies this to the ſufferings of Chriſt for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of our ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, 10. Therefore when Chriſt was come, he did cauſe both <hi>Zebach</hi> and <hi>Mincha</hi> to ceaſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.27. both the ſlain Sacrifices, and the Meat-Offerings.</p>
               <p>And it is expreſly ſaid of the poor mans Meat-Offering for his Treſpaſs, that it ſhall make atonement, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.11, 13.</p>
               <p>This is thought to be ſome account of the Apoſtles limitation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. where he ſaith, <hi>That under the Law almoſt all things were purged by blood.</hi> For it was not always done by ſlain Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, but ſometimes by Meat Offerings.</p>
               <p>And as the Scripture is clear for it: ſo indeed the thing it ſelf ſpeaks. For there was in the Meat-Offerings, an expreſs adum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of both the parts of that juſtifying Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, by which we are reconciled to God.</p>
               <p>His Sufferings or paſſive Obedience. For there was a deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Mincha</hi> by fire, and pouring it forth; as well as of the <hi>Zebachim</hi> by fire and blood.</p>
               <p>Here was alſo an adumbration of his active Obedience, or fulfilling all Righteouſneſs, which was his meat and drink. Joh. 4.34. <hi>My meat, is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work.</hi> I know ſome have made ſome queſtion of this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Meat-Offering were Propitiatory, or only Euchariſtical? But you ſee how clear it is, both from the Scripture, and from the Analogy of the thing it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Meat-Offering ſignified alſo the perſons of Believers, who (through Chriſt) are ſanctified and cleanſed to be a pure Oblation or Meat-Offering unto God. They are compared in Scripture to a Meat and Drink-Offering; Iſai. 66.20. <hi>They ſhall
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:96313:140"/>
bring their brethren for a</hi> Mincha <hi>or Meat-Offering unto the Lord.</hi> which was fulfilled in the Converſion of the Gentiles, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.16. and in the ſufferings of the Saints, eſpecially when they ſuffer unto death and martyrdom in the Cauſe of Chriſt. They are a Drink-Offering to the Lord, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly accepted of him; Philip. 2.17. <hi>Yea, if I be offered up as a Drink-Offering</hi> (ſi pro libamento offerar Beza) <hi>upon the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and ſervice of your Faith, I joy and rejoyce with you all.</hi> 2 Tim. 4.6. <hi>For I am now ready to be offered,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>and the time of my departure is at hand.</hi> The Note upon it is this, I am ready to be offered for a Drink-Offering; and he alludeth to the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of blood or wine, which was uſed in Sacrifices.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Meat-Offering ſignified not only their perſons, but their ſervices, thoſe fruits of grace and good works that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers do perform, whether towards God or towards man; which are often compared to fruits, and to meat and drink.</p>
               <p>And the Meat-Offering you know, conſiſted of the Fruits of the Earth, of things to be eat and drunk. Good works are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led fruits, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. and again <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.17. And meat and drink. Joh 4.32. <hi>I have meat to eat that ye know not of,</hi> and what was that? See verſ. 34. <hi>My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work.</hi> As the Meat Offering conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Fruits of the Earth, things to be eat and drunk.</p>
               <p>To inſtance in particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Prayer. Pſal. 141.2. <hi>Let my prayer be ſet before thee as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening</hi> Mincha, <hi>or Meat Offering:</hi> ſo when the Lord told the <hi>Jews, I will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a</hi> Mincha <hi>or Meat Offering at your hands;</hi> he addeth, that in ſtead of them, Mal. 1.10, 11. <hi>From the riſing of the Sun to the going down of the ſame, Incenſe ſhall be offered to my Name, and a pure</hi> Mincha, <hi>a pure Meat-Offering.</hi> which is fulfilled <hi>when men pray every where lifting up pure hands,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 2.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Praiſe and thankful acknowledgment of Gods goodneſs and ſoveraignty, and the intereſt God hath in us, and in all our comforts and enjoyments, which, as they come from him, are thus acknowledged by way of Chief-Rent in Sacrifice. This ſmall
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:96313:141"/>
Rent (as a Peper corn in ſome Leaſes) being an acknowledgment of their Homage, that he is the great Landlord and Owner of all the good they enjoyed: therefore while his Worſhip was neglected, he blaſted them in all their outward comforts, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.9, 10, 11. But when they acknowledged him, he remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>And left a Meat-Offering and a Drink-Offering in the houſe of the Lord,</hi> as Joel 2.14. This is a ſecond duty taught in the Meat-Offering.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some conceive here was a prefiguration alſo of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, and indeed ſomething of Analogy doth appear: for the Meat-Offering did conſiſt of Bread and Wine, as the Lords Supper doth. And as the Meat was eaten by the Prieſts: ſo is the Bread by Believers, who are Goſpel-Prieſts.</p>
               <p>But yet, as in all Similitudes and Types; beſide the Analogy, there be alſo ſundry diſproportions and diſparities, between the Type and the thing typified: ſo here for the Meat-Offering, was both a Feaſt and a Sacrifice, part of it being burnt upon the Altar. But the Lords Supper is only a Feaſt and not a Sacrifice, being wholly eaten by the Prieſts.</p>
               <p>The Meat-Offering did refer to what was future, the Lords Supper to what is paſt: that was a prefiguration of the true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; the Lords Supper is a commemoration of it.</p>
               <p>In the Meat-Offering the Wine was only poured forth before the Lord: but in the Lords Supper, the Communicants are to drink it. <hi>Drink ye all of it.</hi> Mat. 26.27.</p>
               <p>In a word, that was a Type; this a Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a fourth duty which the Sacrifice of the Meat-Offering may refer to, and that is, Almes, bounty and liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Saints, and to the Poor: this is a true Sacrifice, and a Goſpel Meat-Offering. The Apoſtle ſeems to ſpeak of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a notion; Heb. 13.16. <hi>To do good, and to communicate forget not, for with ſuch Sacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi> And <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.17, 18.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Meat-Offering ſhadowed forth the acceptation of our perſons and ſervices with the Lord: ſo in the places before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.17, 18. the Apoſtle calls what the <hi>Philippians</hi>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:96313:141"/>
ſent unto him for his ſupply, <hi>An Odour of a ſweet ſmell, a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice acceptable, well pleaſing unto God.</hi> ſee Mal. 1.10. God rejects the <hi>Jews,</hi> but accepts the Gentiles in their ſtead, together with their prayers and ſervices, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Upon this account, Frankincenſe was an Ingredient in the Meat-Offering, to make a ſweet ſmell; Hoſ. 9.4. <hi>They ſhall not offer Wine Offerings to the Lord, neither ſhall they be pleaſing unto him.</hi> The Lord hath ſometimes given ſignal evidence and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his good acceptance of this Sacrifice, and of his people therein: ſee 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.9, 10, 20.</p>
               <p>So that look as our Reconciliation to God, was in a ſpecial manner taught and held forth by the Burnt-Offering: ſo our Sanctification and acceptation with him, is in a peculiar manner taught and ſhadowed forth in the Meat-Offering: which hath occaſioned ſome to reſtrain it to this Scope only, though that is a miſtake as hath been ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the general Myſteries adumbrated and ſhadowed forth in the Meat-Offering, namely, Jeſus Chriſt his atoning and reconciling us to God: as alſo Believers, their perſons, their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, the acceptance of both before God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Enquiry touching the Meat-Offering is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the additions forbidden to be annexed to it; which were two, <hi>Leaven and Honey.</hi> verſ. 11.</p>
               <p>The reaſon and intent of this, is worthy to be conſidered and enquired into.</p>
               <p>And firſt for the literal ſenſe and meaning of the Prohibition, it is concerning Fire-Offerings at the Brazen Altar: Leaven and Honey might not come upon the Altar; but yet Leaven was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and allowed in Thank Offerings, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.13. and in the Offerings of Firſt Fruits, <hi>Cap</hi> 23.17. So here in this ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Verſ. 12. it is thought to be ſpoken by way of caution; they might offer it leavened, but not ſacrificed at the Altar.</p>
               <p>Honey alſo is numbered among the Firſt-Fruits, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31.5. Though ſome underſtand that of <hi>Dates,</hi> which are as ſweet as Honey. This 12. <hi>verſ.</hi> ſome explain it thus: ye ſhall offer them to the Lord for a Wave-Offering, but not for an Oblation at the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:96313:142"/>
Altar. This is ſtrictly forbidden both in this and in divers other Scriptures as in reference to the Paſſover, and that very ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the pain of Extermination or cutting off, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.19. And in <hi>Amos</hi> 4.5. they are ſarcaſtically reproved for it: for that Interpretation agrees beſt with the Scope.</p>
               <p>Now for the Reaſons of the Prohibition.</p>
               <p>And firſt for Leaven: Leaven you know hath a ſower taſte, (it hath its name) one of its names in Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> from the ſowerneſs of the taſte Vinegar is a Conjugate from the ſame Root, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Chometz Jajin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it hath a ſowring and a ſwelling quality and property, and an infecting ſpreading quality, when it is put into a Batch of Dough, it ceaſeth not till it hath made all the reſt like unto it ſelf: as our Saviour ſpeaks of it, Mat. 13.33. <hi>Leaven which a Woman took and hid in three meaſures of Meal, till the whole was leavened.</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle Gal. 5.9. <hi>A little Leaven leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the whole lump.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Aul. Gellius. <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15.</note>The Heathen did retain by blind Tradition, ſome footſteps of this Ceremony: for the <hi>flamen dialis</hi> or Roman Prieſt, might not by their Canons touch any leavened Meal.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plut.</hi> queſt. Rom. apud <hi>Aynſw.</hi> in Exod. <hi>12.15.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſcanneth the reaſon of it thus; becauſe Leaven it ſelf proceedeth from corruption, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth alſo the Meal with which it is mixed.</p>
               <p>And therefore by the way that Metaphor of Fermentation ſo much uſed by ſome late Philoſophers, it may be doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be always ſo congruous, and ſo full of light to clear up the myſteries of nature, as they ſuppoſe who make ſuch conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual uſe of it; for it is but one kind or way of corruption.</p>
               <p>But for the ſpiritual myſtery of it.</p>
               <p>Leaven argues Corruption, and therefore unleavened, is as much as to ſay uncorrupted.</p>
               <p>I find Leaven applied in Scripture to ſin and ſinners, and Corruptions of all ſorts, and particularly to theſe four.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To falſe Doctrine, Mat. 16.6, 11, 12. <hi>The Leaven of the Phariſees,</hi> is the falſe Doctrine of the Phariſees.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:96313:142"/>2. To ſcandalous and wicked practices; 1 Cor. 5.6, 7, 8. <hi>Purge out the old Leaven, that ye may be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ein lump as ye are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened— Let us keep the Feaſt not with old Leaven, neither with the Leaven of malice and wickedneſs, but with the unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Diſcontent; Pſal. 73.21. <hi>thus my heart was grieved</hi> Or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hebrew Metaphor, thus was my heart leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſowred: <hi>Ki Jithchametze leba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i,</hi> or rather leavened and ſowred it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Malice and cruelty, the Leaven of maliciouſneſs; Pſal. 71.4. <hi>Deliver me O my God, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man,</hi> the leavened perſon, <hi>Chometz.</hi> So likewiſe Pride is fitly compared to Leaven, becauſe it puffs and ſwells the heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To Hypocriſy and ſecret ſins; Luk. 12.1, 2. <hi>the Leaven of the Phariſees, which is Hypocriſy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. To promiſcuous Communion and carnal mixtures in Church ſociety; 1 Cor. 5.6. <hi>A little Leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some are apt to ſay, their ſin will do me no hurt: but you may be deceived in this. I tell thee their ſins may infect and damn thee; <hi>One Fornicator or profane perſon muſt not be allowed in the Church, leſt many be defiled.</hi> Heb. 12.15, 16.</p>
               <p>This is a Truth ſo clear throughout the whole Scripture, that if I were to chooſe what Death I would dye, I think I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver chooſe to dye in a better cauſe, than for bearing witneſs to this Truth. That the Church of God ought not to be made a Den of Thieves, and a Refuge and Receptacle for wicked Livers: there muſt be no ſuch Leaven in the Houſe of God.</p>
               <p>Now put all theſe together, and put them into the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and you ſee a fourfold Inſtruction in this Prohibition of Leaven.</p>
               <p>It teacheth us.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Honey was forbidden alſo; it may ſeem ſtrange that ſo
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:96313:143"/>
ſweet and ſo good a thing ſhould be ſo ſeverely interdicted. How often is the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> commended as a Land <hi>flowing with Milk and Honey?</hi> But <hi>to eat too much of it, is not good.</hi> Prov. 25.16, 27. It cloys and loads the Stomach, and turns to choler and bitterneſs; and if poured upon the Fire, it ſwells and riſeth up in Froth.</p>
               <p>Three things we may learn out of this Prohibition of Honey.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God will be worſhipped according to his own Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Command; his Will is the Rule we muſt ſubmit unto, though we cannot well ſee the reaſon of it.</p>
               <p>We muſt not follow any Invention of our own, though to our carnal thoughts it ſeem as ſweet as Honey, though it ſeem never ſo decent; never ſo orderly: as that is the common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe, it is for decency and orders ſake.</p>
               <p>But what think you Friends, is not Honey ſweet and decent too? But God requires it not: therefore away with it from the Meat-Offerings of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That holy temperature and equability of ſpirit, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Saints in all the conditions and viciſſitudes they paſs through; we muſt take heed of Extremes. There ſhould be neither Leaven nor Honey; neither too much ſower, nor too much ſweet; neither inordinate ſorrow, nor inordinate pleaſures in the Meat-Offering of the Saints; they ſhould neither be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected nor lifted up, but in an even well compoſed frame and temper of Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 10. neither leavened and ſowred with diſcontent under worldly troubles, nor ſurfeited with the ſweatneſs and Honey of carnal pleaſure, and delight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of the Creature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some apply it unto Chriſt himſelf, thus: That there is in Chriſt our Meat-Offering, no ſuch ſweetneſs which turns to loathing, no ſuch pleaſure whereof a man can take too much; there is no glutting, no ſatiety, no after ſorrows, no ſuch delight as proves bitter in the latter end, as much Honey doth. But on the contrary, the more any man taſtes of the ſweetneſs and comfort that is in him, the more he ſhall long for it, and ſay, <hi>Lord evermore give us of this bread.</hi> as Joh. 6.34. more of this
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:96313:143"/>
bread, more of this comfort, this Communion with God. He is not ſweet at firſt, and bitter afterwards: but his Yoke ſeems heavieſt at firſt, but lighter afterward: he ſpeaks firſt of the Croſs, then of the Crown of Glory.</p>
               <p>Theſe four are all in this Chapter; for the other two additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Enquiries, we ſhall borrow Light out of other Scriptures fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to illuſtrate this.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth Enquiry concerning the Meat-Offering is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the appurtenance of Drink-Offerings by divine Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, affixed and annexed to the Meat-Offering.</p>
               <p>I reckon it as an appurtenance to the Meat-Offering, for two Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is not mentioned as a diſtinct Species in that Enumeration of the Legal-Offerings, which hath been ſo often quoted <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.37. The Drink-Offering is there omited, as being included and underſtood in the Meat-Offering.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe it was never offered alone under the Law, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in conjunction with the ſlain Sacrifices, to compleat the Meat-Offering belonging to them.</p>
               <p>It is true, before the Law we read of Drink-Offerings alone; <hi>Jacob</hi> Gen. 35.14. <hi>he ſet up a Pillar in</hi> Bethel, <hi>and he poured a Drink Offering thereon, and he poured Oyl thereon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after that Regulation and Reformation of the Offerings by <hi>Moſes,</hi> we never read of any Drink Offering alone, but only in Conjunction with Meat Offerings, and Slaughter-Offerings. As Numb. 15.5. <hi>And the fourth part of a Hin of Wine for a Drink-Offering ſhalt thou prepare, with the Burnt-Offering, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for one Lamb.</hi> And verſ. 7. <hi>For a Ram, thou ſhalt offer for a Drink-Offering the third part of a Hin.</hi> And again verſ. 11. <hi>For a Bullock.</hi> And Numb. 28.7. <hi>The Drink Offering thereof ſhall be the fourth part of an Hin for one Lamb,</hi> &amp;c. Lev. 23.18. <hi>They ſhall be for a Burnt Offering unto the Lord, with their Meat-Offerings, and their Drink Offerings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in <hi>Hezekia</hi>'s time, when he purged the Houſe of God, it is ſaid 2 Chron. 29.35. <hi>The Burnt-Offerings were in abundance with the fat of the Peace-Offerings, and the Drink-Offerings for eve By rurnt Offering.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:96313:144"/>I ſhall ſpeak to three things upon the Drink-Offering.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The matter of it.</item>
                  <item>2. The Rite and manner of Oblation.</item>

               <p n="1">1. Firſt then for the matter of it, it was Wine; Numb. 15.5. <hi>Wine for a Drink-Offering ſhalt thou prepare.</hi> Called <hi>Shekar</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.7. from whence the Greek <hi>Sikera,</hi> that is, a ſtrong inebriating Wine; our Tranſlators here render it ſtrong Wine.</p>

               <p>How doth Wine cheer God? It cannot be ſaid to cheer God otherwiſe, than in Offerings and Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>The Heathen fell into an horrible Corruption, as to this; for that they mingled Blood in their idolatrous and ſuperſtitious rage in Drink Offerings, whereto the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> alludes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.4. and declares how he abominates ſuch a practiſe; <hi>Their ſorrows ſhall be multiplied that haſten or give Gifts to another God: their Drink-Offerings of Blood will I not offer.</hi> It is not unlike the Health Drinkers of our times, of whom you may have heard of ſome who (in their raging profanneſs) have mingled their own Blood with Wine, and ſo have drunk it in Healths to the Devil, and to the confuſion of <hi>Sion,</hi> and <hi>Sions</hi> King.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Rite and manner of Oblation was, by pouring of it forth before the Lord: Numb. 28.7. <hi>In the holy place ſhalt thou cauſe ſtrong Wine to be poured out unto the Lord for a Drink Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that is, upon the Altar ſay ſome, but not upon the Fire; or as others beſide the Altar: for it is likely the Wine of the Drink-Offering was to be poured forth, where the blood of the ſlaughtered Sacrifices was poured forth: but that was at the bottom of the Altar, as you have formerly heard upon <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. with <hi>Cap.</hi> 8.15.</p>
               <p>Hence it hath its name in Hebrew <hi>Neſek, libamen,</hi> a ſacred effuſion, or a pouring out; from the Verb <hi>Naſak, fudit, effudit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were not to drink it; that might have been an occaſion of intemperance and drunkenneſs, there being dayly and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:96313:144"/>
Drink-Offerings; nay there was no piece of legal worſhip wherein they were commanded to drink Wine.</p>
               <p>But there is an expreſs prohibition of any ſuch Rite; Lev. 10.8, 9. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>ſaying, Do not drink Wine or ſtrong drink, thou nor thy Sons with thee, when you go into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, leſt you die.</hi> Verſ. 10. <hi>And that you may put difference between holy and unholy, and between un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and clean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſpiritual Myſtery of it. Doubtleſs it had much of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual myſtery in it: the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> calls it <hi>the Cup of Salvation.</hi> Pſal. 116.13. <hi>I will take the Cup of Salvation and call upon the Name of the Lord,</hi> for what other Adminiſtration under the Law that expreſſion could relate unto, beſides this, I know not: there being no other uſe of Cups of Wine amongſt them in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, but only in theſe Drink-Offerings whereof we ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Three things I ſhall briefly note.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wine in typical and allegorical Scriptures, doth ſometimes ſignify the joys and conſolations of the Holy Ghoſt: for Wine rejoyces and cheers the heart, Pſal. 104.15. <hi>Wine that maketh glad the heart of man.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.18. ſo ſpeaks, <hi>Be not inebriated with Wine wherein is exceſs, but be ye filled with the Spirit.</hi> The Apoſtles Antitheſis between Wine and the Spirit intimates this; Cant. 1.2. <hi>Thy love is better than Wine.</hi> And verſ. 4. <hi>We will be glad and rejoyce in thee, we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy love more than Wine.</hi> And Cant. 2.5. <hi>Stay me with Flagons, comfort me with Apples, for I am ſick of love. Stay me with Flagons,</hi> that is, with Flagons of Wine. <hi>Metonymia ſubjecti continentis pro contento.</hi> As in the Supper the Cup is put for the Wine. <hi>This Cup is my blood,</hi> that is, the Wine in the Cup: ſo here <hi>Stay me with Flagons,</hi> ſhe prays for the ſenſe of his Love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We find the Saints pouring out their blood in the Cauſe of Chriſt, compared to a Drink-Offering, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.27. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6, And ſo is in an higher, in a much higher ſenſe the blood of Chriſt repreſented by Wine in the Sacrament of the Supper, as his Fleſh by Bread: and ſo the Meat and Wine in the Meat-Offering, may alſo repreſent his Fleſh and Blood.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:96313:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. It ſhadowed forth the Lords acceptance of his people, <hi>Shall I leave my Wine wherewith I cheer both God and man?</hi> Judg. 9.13. that is, pleaſing to God in Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Hence when the Lord declares his rejection and diſacceptance of them; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.4. he thus expreſſeth it, <hi>they ſhall not offer Wine Offerings to the Lord, neither ſhall they be pleaſing unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſixth and laſt Enquiry that was propounded concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meat-Offering is, the Seaſons and Occaſions upon which it was to be offered.</p>
               <p>There is the more cauſe to ſpeak to this, both becauſe the Scripture is Copious in it, and becauſe there hath been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of controverſy, and ſomething perhaps of inadvertency and of miſtake about it.</p>
               <p>You may note this in general: There be ſome Offerings which were Meat-Offerings as to their matter, which yet did not come under the Rule of the Meat Offering, as it is here laid down in this ſecond Chapter of <hi>Leviticus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be three Inſtances of this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Wave Sheaf. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.10, 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The two Wave Loaves. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.17. It is true, theſe agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the matter with the Meat-Offering properly ſo called; for they were of the Fruits of the Earth, that were to be eaten: but yet they did not come under the Rule of the Meat-Offering.</p>
               <p>For they were not <hi>Iſhim</hi> Offerings made by Fire, they were not to be burnt, nor were they moſt holy, to be eaten by the Prieſts alone in the holy place: and they were to be made with Leaven, which is contrary to the ordinary Rule of Meat-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>But they were Heave-Offerings, which were but ſingly and not doubly holy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Inſtance is the Jealouſy-Offering. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. which differs from the Meat Offering, partly in the matter. For the Jealouſy-Offering was not fine Flower, nor yet Flower of Wheat, <hi>Qemach Sheirim</hi> Meal of Barley; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſome render it the Bran of Barley.</p>
               <p>Barley the courſeſt ſort of Bread-Corn and Bran, the courſeſt
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:96313:145"/>
part of that Grain: not Wheat, but Barley; not Flower, but Meal and no Oyl nor Frankincenſe with it.</p>
               <p>It differed alſo and chiefly in the end and uſe, the Meat-Offering being for expiation, as hath been formerly proved: but the Jealouſy-Offering was for exploration and diſcovery of guilt or innocence. It was for a Memorial, but not for a Memorial of acceptation, but to bring ſin to remembrance, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.15.</p>
               <p>For theſe Reaſons, though there be ſomething of general agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being of the Fruits of the earth, and ſo may be called a Meat-Offering in a general ſenſe, and ſo accordingly is called <hi>Mincha, verſ.</hi> 15. Yet you ſee how much it differs from the Rule of the Meat-Offering, in this ſecond of <hi>Leviticus;</hi> therefore it was not properly a Meat Offering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But when then was the Meat Offering offered? And what Offerings were there under the Law, that come more fully under that notion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> They were of two ſorts, either ſeparate, or conjoyned with other Offerings. Of ſeparate Meat Offerings there are two ſignal Inſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The poor mans Treſpaſs Offering, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.11, 12. in ſtead of the Treſpaſs Offering of Cattel, becauſe of his poverty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Shew Bread, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24, 7, 9.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to have been a Meat-Offering for the Incenſe was burnt as a Memorial for the Bread, ſay ſome.</p>
               <p>Or as others; an handful of the Flower whereof they were made, was burnt for the whole: and the reſt was eaten by the Prieſts, after they had been preſented, and had ſtood for a time before the Lord: ſo much as to ſeparate Meat Offerings.</p>
               <p>Now 2. as to Meat Offerings conjoyned with other Offerings.</p>
               <p>The general Rule is this. That they were conjoyned with Burnt Offerings of Cattel, and with Peace Offerings, whether offered as Vows, or as Freewil-Offerings, or at their ſolemn Feaſts, and in ſundry other incidental occaſions.</p>
               <p>But they were not conjoyned with Burnt Offerings of Fowls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor with Sin, or Treſpaſs Offerings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>This Rule is both affirmative and negative, it is grounded upon <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.4, 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:96313:146"/>Hence as there was a dayly Burnt-Offering, ſo there was a dayly Meat-Offering; <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.4, 5.</p>
               <p>And ſometimes the Lord gave ſignal teſtimonies of his accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it, as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.9, 10, 20. So at the Conſecration of the Prieſts and Levites, <hi>Lev.</hi> 8.26, 27. And <hi>Lev.</hi> 9.4. At the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of the Levites, <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.8. At the Expiration of the Nazarites Vow, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.17. At the Dedication of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle. there were twelve Meat-Offerings according to the number of the Tribes, <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.13, 14.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Sheaf of Firſt Fruits, though it ſelf was a Wave-Offering, yet there was a Meat-Offering annexed to them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.18.</p>
               <p>So that generally where you have a Burnt-Offering, or a Peace-Offering under the Law, whether under the notion of a Vow or a Freewil-Offering, or at their ſtated Feaſts, and in moſt incidental occaſions, though I cannot ſay in all, for it is not mentioned in the purification of women after Child-bed, <hi>Levit.</hi> 12.6. They had a Meat-Offering by divine Inſtitution, annexed and conjoyned with it.</p>
               <p>The other part of the Rule is negative, and it is this: we do not find that Meat-Offerings were annexed unto the Burnt-Offerings of Fowls, or to Sin, or Treſpaſs Offerings, or to Firſt-Fruits, or Tythes, or to the Paſchal-Lamb, though to the Feaſt of the Paſſover they were, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.1, 2. And in the cleanſing of the Leper, the Meat-Offering ſeems to be annexed to the Sin-Offering, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14.10. which is a peculiar Caſe.</p>
               <p>This Rule is drawn from the authority of the Scripture nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, there being no ſuch annecting of it unto theſe in that place, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. where it is annexed unto Burnt-Offerings and Peace-Offerings: but where it was not commanded, where they were not directed to it in the Law, they might not do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> See the fulneſs of ſpiritual Myſtery, and the plenty of Goſpel Light and Teaching, that is in the Sacrifice of the Meat-Offering.</p>
               <p>To recapitulate briefly ſome Heads of things, which have been more largely opened to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:96313:146"/>It relates both to Chriſt and Chriſtians, and is full of ſpiritual myſtery as to both.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to Chriſt, he is the true Meat-Offering, the Food of our Souls: it was to conſiſt of fine Flower, to denote his Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Purity.</p>
               <p>The baking, frying, drying, beating of it: points us to his Sufferings, and ſo doth the burning of it upon the Altar.</p>
               <p>The pouring forth the Wine belonging to the Meat-Offering, plainly repreſents the pouring out his Blood.</p>
               <p>The Green Ears, repreſents Chriſt as the Firſt Fruits, by whom all the reſt is ſanctified.</p>
               <p>The Prieſts eating it, tells us how Believers feed upon Chriſt by Faith, as the Bread of Life.</p>
               <p>The Oyl, is the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Incenſe, his Prayers and Mediation, and the efficacy and acceptance thereof with God for us.</p>
               <p>The Salt of the Covenant, is the ſtability and everlaſting faithfulneſs of God as our God, in a Covenant Relation through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The prohibition of Leaven and Honey, frees Chriſt from all Corruption of life and doctrine, and all ſuch deceiving comfort, which afterwards like Honey turns to bitterneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Apply it to Chriſt myſtical, to the Saints and Members of Chriſt, for it may be ſo applied: the Gentiles under the Goſpel are preſented as an acceptable Meat-Offering to the Lord, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.20. Every particular and circumſtance of it is full of teaching.</p>
               <p>The Fine Flower, teaches us to purge our ſelves from the Bran of our natural Corruption.</p>
               <p>We muſt be anointed with the Unction of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Incenſe, teaches us to be much in prayer, and to expect acceptance with the Lord.</p>
               <p>The Salt, inſtructs us in the ſafety of our Covenant-Eſtate and Intereſt in God: and that our ſpeeches and whole deportment, ſhould be ſavoury and ſeaſoned with Salt.</p>
               <p>The forbidding of Leaven and Honey, calls upon us to purge out the Old Leaven of ſinful Corruption, and to take heed of the ſweetneſs and pleaſures of ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:96313:147"/>I beſeech you brethren do not reſt in the notional underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Truths, but reduce all to practice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> Joh. 13.17. <hi>But if you know all myſteries, and have not love,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.1, 2. <hi>it profiteth nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to preſs you a little further; you may obſerve, that the Meat-Offering under the Goſpel, is larger than it was under the Law; as you will find if you compare <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46. For in <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.5. the Meat-Offering is but the tenth part of an Ephah, it is but the fourth part of an Hin of beaten oyl. But in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46.13, 14 it is augmented, the Meat-Offering to a ſixth part of an Ephah, and the third part of an Hin of oyl.</p>
               <p>This ſpeaks a greater degree of fruitfulneſs and more ample obedience under the Goſpel, then was of old under the Law.</p>
               <p>That look as the Grace of God in Chriſt abounds towards us under the Goſpel, ſo ſhould we abound in our Returns of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and fruitful obedience. 1 Tim. 1.14. <hi>And the Grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Can you not go along with the Apoſtle in thoſe expreſſions? Hath not God abounded towards you in Mercy and free Grace? Have you not ſometimes ſaid, never ſuch a Pattern of Mercy, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the like Riches of free Grace, if the Lord pardoned ſuch ſins, and heal ſuch backſlidings: therefore be you abundant in the work of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>ult.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. For the name; it is <hi>Shelamim</hi> which we render the Peace-Offering, and <hi>Zebach Shelamim</hi> the Sacrifice of the Peace-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; from <hi>Shalom pax,</hi> ſo called, becauſe it was a Sacrifice of Peace Offering amongſt all the parties: God, and the Prieſts, and the people being all partakers of it, as being all agreed, and therefore ſociable partakers of the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:96313:148"/>The word may be otherwiſe rendred; but this Interpretation is moſt generally received, and ſuits well with the nature of this Sacrifice of Peace-Offerings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ends occaſions and ſeaſons of the Peace-Offerings (for we may put all theſe together) Firſt as to their ends, they were of a mixt nature, they were both Hilaſtical, Euchariſtical and Euctical, both for atonement, and for thankſgiving, and for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: they were in general for peace and reconciliation with God.</p>
               <p>Some I know have queſtioned this, which I muſt confeſs I have often wondred at, and they have thought it meerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of moral duties, of homage and thankfulneſs to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it was a Fire-Offering upon the Brazen Altar; all the reſt of which, were for reconciliation and atonement, and therefore why not this?</p>
               <p>It is ſaid to be <hi>a ſavour of reſt.</hi> verſ. 5. which ſignifies Gods acceptation. The Actions about it, ſpeak forth this end; for it was ſlain and burnt upon the Altar, the Blood poured forth and ſprinkled upon the Altar round about, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All pointing to Jeſus Chriſt, who is indeed the true Peace-Offering. Epheſ. 2.14. <hi>He is our Peace,</hi> and <hi>he hath made peace by the blood of his Croſs;</hi> Col. 2.20. Yet this was but the general, and not the ſpecial, nor the only end of them.</p>
               <p>There be two particular ends mentioned in <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Peace enjoyed, to teſtify their thankfulneſs.</item>
                  <item>2. Peace deſired and ſought after; each of which had their different Rites, of which afterwards.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. One end was for thankſgiving, by way of Retribution for mercies received. <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.11, 12. of which <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.22. <hi>And let them ſacrifice the Sacrifices of thankſgiving, and declare his works with rejoycing.</hi> Heb. 13.15. <hi>By him therefore let us offer the Sacrifice of praiſe to God continually,</hi> acknowledging Chriſt in all our mercies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another end of the Peace-Offerings, was for the impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or obtaining of mercies wanted, either in the way of a Vow, or a Freewil-Offering, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.16— <hi>Judg.</hi> 20.26. The Tribes in their Faſt for obtaining victory againſt the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> offered
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:96313:148"/>
Peace-Offerings in the way of a Freewil-Offering. Pſal. 56.12. <hi>Thy Vows are upon me O God, I will render praiſes unto thee.</hi> Or I will pay confeſſions unto thee; that is, he would in a way of praiſe, offer the Peace-Offerings that he had vowed. So Jonah 2.9. <hi>But I will ſacrifice unto thee with the voice of thankſgiving, I will pay that I have vowed: Salvation is of the Lord. Gen.</hi> 28.20, 21, 22. The tenth of all that God ſhould give him, <hi>Jacob</hi> vowed to give to God, that is, as a Peace-Offering.</p>
               <p>The difference between a Vow and a Freewil-Offering was only this. That in the Freewil-Offering they did preſent the thing it ſelf unto the Lord; but in a Vow they did firſt promiſe it, being (it may be) not in a capacity to perform it at that time. As <hi>Jonah</hi> in the <hi>Whales</hi> belly: and then when the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance was beſtowed, and the Prayer heard and granted, they paid their Vows unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>Hence ſome have thus referred and compared theſe three ſorts of Offerings hitherto deſcribed, and directed in this Book.</p>
               <p>That as the Burnt-Offering <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. principally figured our Reconciliation to God, by the death of Jeſus Chriſt: and the Meat-Offering <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. had a ſpecial reſpect to our Sanctification in him before God: ſo this Peace-Offering, ſignified both Chriſts Oblation of himſelf, whereby he became our Peace and our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and likewiſe our Oblation of Praiſe, Thankſgiving and Prayer unto God, in the midſt of our troubles, temptations and ſpiritual conflicts, which we fight by Faith in this world: ſo that in this Sacrifice, <hi>we come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may receive Mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need,</hi> as Heb. 4.16.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſome have noted, that this Sacrifice of Peace-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was often added under the Law to other ſorts of Sacrifices. Becauſe, beſide the expiation of ſin by the Blood of Chriſt, there muſt be an effectual application of the atonement in a way of actual communion with God, in a way of grace and peace through Jeſus Chriſt. Chriſt doth not only procure peace for us, but Communicate and apply it to us.</p>
               <p>Here was an actual Participation, and an exerciſe of mutual
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:96313:149"/>
Communion between God and the Prieſt, and the Offerers feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What were the times and ſeaſons when they offered and were to offer Peace Offerings?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> They were either Occaſional, or more ſtated.</p>
               <p>The Occaſional times, were either, 1. in thankſgiving; or 2. as Vows; or 3. as Freewil-Offerings, which were formerly ſpoken to.</p>
               <p>The more ſtated times are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. At the Conſecration of the Prieſts. <hi>One of the Rams is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Peace Offering.</hi> Exod. 29.28. And at the firſt Conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Family, Lev. 9.4. <hi>Alſo a Bullock and a Ram for Peace Offerings, to ſacrifice before the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. At the expiration of a Nazaretical Vow; Numb. 6.14. <hi>One Lamb without blemiſh for a Peace Offering.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. At the Dedication of the Tabernacle. <hi>Each of the twelve Princes of the twelve Tribes of Iſrael, brought for a Sacrifice of Peace Offerings two Oxen, five Rams, five Hee Goats of the firſt year.</hi> Numb. 7.17.</p>
               <p>So at the Dedication of the Temple by <hi>Solomon.</hi> 1 King. 8.62, 63. Solomon <hi>offered a Sacrifice of Peace-Offerings which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto the Lord, two and twenty thouſand Oxen, and a hundred and twenty thouſand Sheep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. In the Feaſt of Firſt Fruits. <hi>Two Lambs of the firſt year for a Sacrifice of Peace-Offerings.</hi> Lev. 23.19.</p>
               <p>As for the Offerings at the Purification of a Leper; <hi>the two Birds.</hi> Lev. 14. It differs ſo much from the ordinary Rule of the Peace-Offerings, that it cannot well be annumerated to them: but it was a peculiar Sacrifice of Purification, of which we ſhall ſpeak hereafter.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe <hi>the Paſſover Lamb.</hi> Exod. 12. though Euchariſtical; yet cannot well be reduced to the Peace Offerings, or to any of the ſix ordinary kinds: but was indeed a peculiar Sacrifice, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving other Rites than what belonged to the Peace Offering.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The matter of the Peace Offering: it was either of the Herd, or of the Flock; either of the bigger, or of the leſſer ſort of Cattel; either Lambs or Goats.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:96313:149"/>There was no Peace-Offering of Fowls, as there was of <hi>Turtle Doves</hi> and young <hi>Pigeons</hi> in the Burnt-Offering.</p>
               <p>The reaſon whereof is thought to be, becauſe this was to be divided amongſt ſo many; to God, and the Prieſt, and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers: but in Birds being ſo ſmall, this diviſion could not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be made.</p>
               <p>Moreover it muſt be without blemiſh, and this was required before in the Burnt-Offering, and indeed in all their Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>And finally the Peace Offering, it might be either Male or Female; which was otherwiſe in the Law of the Burnt-Offering, that was to be Males only. <hi>Cap</hi> 1.3.</p>
               <p>This Interpreters do apply ſpiritually to the eſtate of the Church in Chriſt, in whom there is neither Male nor Female. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28.</p>
               <p>He that accepteth a Female in his Sacrifice, doth not exclude Women from his Service: they are not excluded from his Love, and therefore ſhould not count themſelves freed from his Law.</p>
               <p>It was a good ſpeech of a Woman that was a Martyr, Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered as much for the redeeming of our Souls, as he did for Men: and therefore, why ſhould not we have as much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage as they to ſuffer for him? God is no Reſpecter of perſons.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Rites and Ceremonies of the Peace-Offering, they were of two ſorts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Common unto this, with other Offerings.</item>
                  <item>2. Peculiar to the Peace-Offerings.</item>
               </list>
               <p>As to the former ſort, there be five ſacred Ceremonies required here, which were mentioned before in the Burnt-Offering <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. and accordingly were there explained. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It muſt be brought to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Owner muſt lay his hands upon it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It muſt be killed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The blood ſhed and ſprinkled upon the Altar round about.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Burning it upon the Altar; all which having been explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before when we were upon the Burnt-Offering. We may now proceed to the ſecond ſort, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:96313:150"/>2. Such Rites as are here firſt mentioned, as having ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar reſpect to the Sacrifice of Peace-Offerings.</p>
               <p>Now theſe may be reduced to four Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The diviſion of it into three parts, namely between God and the Prieſt and the people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The limitation of time, for eating the Prieſts and peoples part, to wit, upon the ſame day, or the next.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The addition of Leaven.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The prohibition of fat and blood.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ſacred Rites and Ceremonies that were peculiar to the Peace-Offerings; the reaſons and myſteries whereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a little opening.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The diviſion of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1. It was divided into 3. parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Some parts of it were to be burnt before the Lord upon the Altar, upon the Burnt-Offering, <hi>viz.</hi> all the Suet and the Fat of the Inwards, the two Kidneys, the Cawl upon the Liver, or the Midriffe and all their Fat.</p>
               <p>This is repeated three times over, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning the Peace-Offerings of the Herd, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4. And again concerning the Lamb, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10. And again laſtly concerning the Goat, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15. Only with this difference, That in the Peace Offering of Lambs, there is added the whole Rump; verſ. 9. <hi>the fat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and the whole Rump, it ſhall he take off hard by the Back Bone.</hi> Whereof ſome Interpreters give this account, That this in ſome kind of Sheep is very great and fat, eſpecially in thoſe parts of the world. As <hi>Plinie lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 48.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is here commanded to be burnt upon the Altar, with the other Fat and Inwards: ſo <hi>Aynſw. in loc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others give this account of it, That there is not the meaneſt part of the Creature, but God hath a right unto it: and though it be a thing never ſo contemptible in it ſelf, God can make it honourable and ſacred, by applying it to his ſervice.</p>
               <p>As the Rump here in the Sacrifice of Peace Offerings.</p>
               <p>And ſo the Foreskin in the Sacrament of Circumciſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11. Thus our own Annotators in <hi>Lev.</hi> 3.9.</p>
               <p>Theſe parts of the Peace-Offering muſt be offered: <hi>Yal ha yola
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:96313:150"/>
in holocauſtum</hi> for a Burnt-Offering, as ſome render it; that is, theſe parts were in ſtead of the whole, and had the uſe and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the whole Burnt-Offering. Here is <hi>pars pro toto,</hi> a ſynec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochical Offering, as we ſhall meet with many ſuch kind of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations under the Law, wherein a part is equivalent and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as in ſtead of the whole.</p>
               <p>Others Interpret it thus, <hi>Yal hayola;</hi> that is, upon the Burnt-Offering, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as being added to it.</p>
               <p>The Burnt-Offering was offered firſt, before any other Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and then this and other Offerings, ſuperadded to it.</p>
               <p>And ſo we may learn this out of it, That we are firſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto God by the death of his Son, applyed and received of us by Faith, before any Oblation of ours can be acceptable to him.</p>
               <p>This ſacrificed part of the Peace-Offering, is called <hi>the Bread of the Altar, and the Bread of God.</hi> Verſ. 11— Numb. 28.2. <hi>My Offering and my Bread for my Sacrifices made by Fire, ſhall ye ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to offer to me</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are called his Bread, becauſe the Fire of the Altar did conſume and eat them up: and ſo the Juſtice of God devours and feeds upon the ſinner.</p>
               <p>The fierceneſs of the Wrath of God againſt ſin and ſinners burning as fire, and devouring Souls: and the neceſſity of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and atonement by the blood of Chriſt, in order to our peace with God; are the general Truths held forth and taught in all the Sacrifices, and ſo in this of Peace-Offerings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God and the Altar being thus fed and ſatisfied in the firſt place, the reſt of the Peace-Offering was divided between the Prieſt and the Owner that brought it, to be eaten by them.</p>
               <p>The Prieſts part was the Breaſt, and the right Shoulder.</p>
               <p>The Owner had the reſt.</p>
               <p>This appears out of the 7. <hi>Chapter</hi> of this Book: the Breaſt was to be waved before the Lord for a Wave-Offering, <hi>verſ.</hi> 30.31.</p>
               <p>The Shoulder to be heaved or lifted up before him for an Heave-Offering, <hi>verſ.</hi> 32, 33.</p>
               <p>The Offerer with his Family was to eat the reſt, ſuch of them
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:96313:151"/>
as were clean, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19, 20, 21. nay the unclean might not ſo much as touch it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. under pain of Extermination; if they did, it made the fleſh unclean.</p>
               <p>Firſt as to the Prieſts part, we are here taught again that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Truth of the maintenance of Miniſters.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſpells out this Leſſon to us, 1 Cor. 9.13, 14. <hi>They that ſerve at the Altar, muſt live of the Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that the Breaſt and the Shoulder was for them; ſome have applyed a little more particularly thus.</p>
               <p>That the Prieſts ſhould be as Breaſts and Shoulders; that is, Counſellors and Supporters to the people, preaching to the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant with the Wiſdom of a prudent Breaſt, and bearing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the Weak, with the ſtrength of a patient Shoulder.</p>
               <p>Others thus, (1) he was to have the Shoulder becauſe of his bearing the people, and carrying them and their Sacrifices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.<note place="margin">Lee Temple pag. <hi>346.</hi>
                  </note> And (2) the Breaſt, the ſeat of the heart; to note his compaſſion tenderneſs and bowels to them, bearing them always in his prayers upon his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord.</p>
               <p>Both which Accommodations are ingenious and ſpiritual, and taken from the nature of the things: but the ſafeſt way, is to obſerve what hints the Scripture gives: thoſe Senſes are ſolid, and carry the beſt evidence of light and demonſtration with them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as to the Offerer with his Family or Friends par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of it: here was an exerciſe of Communion, as 1 Cor. 10.21. <hi>They have communion with Devils that eat of Idols Feaſts:</hi> ſo this ſignified their communion with, and Incorporation into Chriſt. Here was an holy Feaſt wherein they did rejoyce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord; Deut. 12.6, 7. <hi>And thither ſhall you bring your Burnt-Offerings, and your Sacrifices, and your Tythes, and Heave-Offerings of your hand, and your Vows, and your Free-Will Offerings, and the Firſtlings of your Herd, and of your Flocks, and there you ſhall eat before the Lord your God, and ye ſhall rejoyce in all that you put your hand unto, ye and your Houſholds wherein the Lord thy God hath bleſſed thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt learn to enjoy all our Enjoyments in and for the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:96313:151"/>
Lord, and to rejoyce in Communion with him, in ſpiritual feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his Table.</p>
               <p>Eating the Peace-Offering, is feeding upon Chriſt by Faith, and holy rejoycing in him.</p>
               <p>Chriſt was not offered for the Prieſts alone, or communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them alone, but for the people alſo.</p>
               <p>And that the unclean are ſo ſtrictly excluded from either eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſo much as touching it. We ſee how dangerous a thing it is, for unclean and unworthy perſons to participate in the Feaſts of the Lord. Hypocrites that partake of the Sacraments in their uncleanneſs and receive unworthily, <hi>they eat and drink their own damnation.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.27, 28, 29. The fleſh of theſe Sacrifices being a figure of the fleſh of Chriſt, to be eaten of the Saints by Faith.</p>
               <p>This Law ſignified, that Unbelievers, Hypocrites, and wicked ones that profeſs the Goſpel, and partake of the Signs and Seals of Grace unworthily, <hi>do eat and drink Judgment to themſelves. Aynſw.</hi> in Lev. 7.22.</p>
               <p>As no Peace-Offering belongs to the unclean: ſo <hi>there is no peace to the Wicked ſaith my God. To the Wicked God ſaith, what haſt thou to do to take my Covenant into thy mouth, ſeeing thou hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to be reformed.</hi> Pſal. 50.</p>
               <p>And here comes in that <hi>Quoere</hi> concerning the Peace-Offerings, whether they were of the Holy of Holies, whether they had the double, or only the ſingle Holineſs?</p>
               <p>They are not called moſt holy, as the other five ſorts are. The reaſon whereof is, becauſe that ſome part of them was eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by the people; but yet a part alſo was burnt upon the Altar, and another part eaten by the Prieſts, and theſe parts were moſt holy, though the whole was not.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſome have called the Peace Offering, <hi>Sacrificium va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> a divers Sacrifice, as being partly holy, and partly moſt holy. And the other ſorts they call <hi>ſimplex,</hi> by a ſimple Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, intending that which was all of it moſt holy: and the whole, was to ſhadow out the Sacrifice and ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo <hi>Mede. Diſc.</hi> 49.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:96313:152"/>2. The ſecond Ceremony of the Peace-Offering, was the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of time for the eating of it.</p>
               <p>The parts belonging to the Prieſt, and to the Offerer, muſt be eaten by them the ſame day, or the next: but if any was left till the third day, it muſt be burnt with fire. <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.15, 16, 17.18.</p>
               <p>And here there is a diſtinction in the Rule between the two ſorts or occaſions of Peace-Offerings, namely, That if it were for Thankſgiving, it muſt be eaten the ſame day that it is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but if it were for a Vow, or a voluntary Offering, it muſt be eaten within two days. The former Rule is in <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. The Rule for the latter is in <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>But how if they did not obſerve this Rule; ſee the penalty in <hi>verſ.</hi> 17.18. To eat any of it upon the third day, was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable and abominable; ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 17, 18. It is forbidden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the penalty of utter Extermination.</p>
               <p>There might be ſomething of a natural Reaſon for this; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the fleſh might putrefy in that hot Climate, if kept longer.</p>
               <p>But ſurely this is not all that was intended in ſuch a ſevere and vehement Prohibition.</p>
               <p>Therefore there be alſo two ſpiritual Myſteries, that ſeem to be intended and aimed at by the Spirit of God in this Ceremony.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To teach us, that we ſhould make haſte and not delay Communion with God, in the exerciſe of Faith and thankful obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Do not delay and put off the work of Believing: but receive Chriſt, and Communicate of him in this our day.</p>
               <p>This Inſtruction is clear and evident out of this Ceremony; for ſeeing eating ſignifies our feeding upon Chriſt by Faith, and to day and to morrow denotes a ſhort time: therefore this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us ſpeedily to lay hold upon the Mercy of God in Chriſt, and to feed upon this our Peace-Offering <hi>while it is called to day,</hi> according to that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.7, 8— <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12, 13, 15.</p>
               <p>So for other duties of obedience, we ſhould not delay the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of our joy and thankfulneſs to God. Pſal. 119.60. <hi>I made haſte and delayed not to keep thy Commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had a like Rule touching the Paſſover. Exod. 12.10.
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:96313:152"/>
                  <hi>Ye ſhall let nothing of it remain until the morning, and that which remaineth of it until the morning, ye ſhall burn with fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One ſcope whereof was, to teach us to lay hold on preſent opportunities. Do not protract the time; there is a day of Peace after which, when once expired, it is too late: God will not accept thy Peace-Offerings then.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is thought to have reſpect unto Chriſts Reſurrection, which was upon the third day: therefore he ſaith Luk. 13.32. <hi>Behold I caſt out Devils, and I do Cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I ſhall be perfected.</hi> Then he ended his work and ſtate of humiliation for our Redemption, and had no more to do in a way of Sacrifice and Peace-Offering for our ſins. In which reſpect, the number of <hi>three</hi> was a myſtical number under the Law, as well as the number <hi>ſeven:</hi> the Scripture often ſets a mark upon it. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was offered the <hi>third day.</hi> Gen. 22.4.</p>
               <p>Againſt the <hi>third day</hi> they were to be ready to receive the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> Exod. 19.10, 11. <hi>Sanctify the people to day and to morrow, and let them waſh their Clothes and be ready againſt the third day, for the third day the Lord will come down in the ſight of all the people upon Mount</hi> Sinai: ſo the Ark went before them <hi>three days</hi> before it reſted. Numb. 10.33. <hi>And they depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Mount of the Lord three days journey, and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord went before them in the three days journey, to ſearch out a reſting place for them: And after three days to paſs over</hi> Jordan <hi>into</hi> Canaan. Joſh. 1.11.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>third day</hi> the unclean perſon was to purify himſelf: but if he purify not himſelf the <hi>third day,</hi> then the <hi>ſeventh day</hi> he ſhall not be clean. <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.12.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>third day Hezekiah</hi> went up into the houſe of the Lord and recovered from the ſentence of death, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 29.5. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.2. <hi>After two days he will revive us, in the third day he will raiſe us up, and we ſhall live in his ſight.</hi> With many other memorable things: all which intimates ſomething of myſtery in the <hi>third day.</hi> And the greateſt Diſpenſation that ever was upon <hi>that day,</hi> was the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, after he had layn part of <hi>three days</hi> in the Grave. Then he was perfected
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:96313:153"/>
and had no more to do in way of Sacrifice and ſatisfaction for our ſins; as after the <hi>third day</hi> there was no more of the Peace-Offering remaining.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Ceremony in the Peace-Offering was this, That they were to offer leavened bread with it. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>This is the more remarkable; for that in all their other Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, Leaven was uſually very ſtrictly and ſeverely forbidden: but here it is required.</p>
               <p>Here we may learn firſt, That it is not the nature of the thing it ſelf, but meerly the will of God, that makes a thing good or evil in his worſhip.</p>
               <p>To put Leaven into any other Offering, it makes the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice odious unto God, and like a ſmoak in his Noſtrils all the day; but if it pleaſe him to require it in the Peace-Offering, then it muſt be uſed.</p>
               <p>So for Honey he forbids it in other Sacrifices, <hi>Lev</hi> 2.11. But in the Firſt Fruits they were to offer Honey; 2 Chron. 31.5. <hi>The Children of Iſrael brought in abundance of the Firſt Fruits of Corn, Wine, Oyl, and Honey, and of all the Increaſe of the Field.</hi> God herein manifeſting his Authority, and the ſupremacy of his Will.</p>
               <p>If it had pleaſed our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to command us to ſign men in his Name, with the ſign of the Croſs, it would have been a duty, and a bleſſed thing to do it: and if he had not commanded us to waſh men with Water in his Name, it would have been a ſinful and an unlawful Adminiſtration to baptize.</p>
               <p>More particularly, Leaven is taken both in a good, and in a bad ſenſe: and I find Interpreters do accommodate and apply it both ways, as to the Sacrifice of the Peace Offerings.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the good ſenſe, thus our Saviour uſeth it in his Parable, Mat. 13.33. <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto Leaven, which a Woman took and hid in three meaſures of Meal, till the whole was leavened.</hi> And you have the ſame Parable recorded again by <hi>Luke Cap.</hi> 13.21.</p>
               <p>The Lord makes uſe of Leaven here, to teach and hold forth unto us the inward and ſecret working of the Word and Spirit
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:96313:153"/>
in the heart, ſanctifying the heart effectually, but gradually, by imperceptible degrees, as Leaven ſeaſons the Lump.</p>
               <p>Thus the joyning of Leaven with the Peace-Offering, may teach us, That we and our ſervices muſt be ſeaſoned with the new Leaven of Grace; whereby the old Leaven of Corruption is changed and altered, and ſo the whole man made ſavoury.</p>
               <p>Look as there is an old Leaven which muſt be purged out; for they that are in the old unſavoury lump of the Fleſh, cannot pleaſe God: ſo there is a new Leaven wherewith every ones heart and life ſhould be ſeaſoned; a new principle of Grace, a ſpirit of Life from God, which in time works out the contrary old principle of ſinful Corruption, as an Antidote that works out poyſon out of the body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take Leaven in the bad ſenſe, and ſo it ſignifies ſinful Corruption. In this ſenſe the Scripture often ſpeaks of it, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Hence we may learn that as God accepteth the Peace-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though offered with Leaven: ſo he accepteth the ſincere endeavours and ſervices of his people, though there be a mixture of ſinful Corruption in them.</p>
               <p>Or if we take Leaven as in that ſenſe of ſorrow and grief, as Pſal. 73.21. <hi>thus my heart was leavened.</hi> Their having ſome ſower Leaven amongſt their Feaſts, may teach us, That in all our rejoycings in this World, there is a mixture of ſorrow; there is no proſperity ſo entire, but hath ſome ſorrow, ſome affliction with it: as there is no day but hath ſome Clouds.</p>
               <p>Roſes have Thornes, Honey hath a Sting, Crowns and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have Cares and Troubles.</p>
               <p>And it is not only ſo in natural Joy, but in thoſe better Joys and Conſolations of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>Spiritual Joy is and ought to be accompanied with godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and is too oft accompanied with a mixture of carnal ſorrow, and unbelieving doubts and fears. There is ſome of this Leaven with the Peace Offerings of praiſe and thankſgiving to the Lord.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Ceremony is this, That they muſt not eat the fat nor blood, but give it wholly to the Lord, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16, 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:96313:154"/>I number this among the Ceremonies of the Peace-Offering, becauſe it is here firſt mentioned; and here indeed was the firſt occaſion for it: for there being no part at all of the Burnt-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be eaten, there was no need there to forbid the eating of fat or blood: but in the Peace-Offerings, they were to eat ſome part; therefore here comes in this exception, reſpecting the Peace-Offerings in the firſt place, though extended likewiſe to all the reſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt Prohibition is of Fat.</p>
               <p>And here firſt for the literal ſenſe of the Ceremony, before we come to the myſtical ſignification.</p>
               <p>There be two Cautions to prevent miſtakes, that the legal Rigor may not ſeem greater then it was indeed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is meant only of that Fat that was to be ſacrificed, as the Suet and Fat of the Kidneys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For of the other Fat that is diffuſed through the reſt of the fleſh, throughout the whole body of the Beaſt, there is no mention in this Reſtriction in the Text; and therefore being not reſtrained and prohibited, we may juſtly preſume, it was allowed and permitted to them, they might lawfully eat of it. Neh. 8.10. <hi>eat the Fat, and drink the ſweet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is meant only of the three kinds of Beaſts, that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be uſed in Sacrifice; for they were permitted to eat the Fat of other clean Beaſts. See <hi>Levit.</hi> 7.23, 25. where this reſtriction of Fat is clearly explained, and reſtrained to the Fat of thoſe three kind of Beaſts.</p>
               <p>Now as to the myſtery and ſpiritual ſignification of this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, that we may learn ſome wholeſome Inſtruction out of it, the beſt way will be this: let us conſider when the Scripture ſpeaks of Fat in an allegorical or metaphorical ſenſe, how is it meant?</p>
               <p>For a Similitude is <hi>typus arbitrarius,</hi> and a legal Ceremony is no more but <hi>typus fixus</hi> or <hi>deſtinatus,</hi> and differs from an Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory or Metaphor or Similitude, only in the fixation or deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it by God, unto ſuch an uſe and end in a ſtated way.</p>
               <p>Now you will find that the Scripture ſpeaks of Fat in ſuch a
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:96313:154"/>
Metaphorical ſenſe two ways, (as was before noted concerning Leaven) both in a good, and in an evil ſenſe, which will give this Type a double aſpect, as that alſo had.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any real abſurdity or incongruity, in the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of a Type, two or three ſeveral ways: for they are not ſo many contrary ſenſes, but only ſo many ſeveral Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or ſpiritual myſteries to be learned out of one of Gods teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Signs: ſuch manifold Inſtructions being all included in the vaſt aim and comprehenſive wiſdom of the Holy Ghoſt, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and chooſing out ſuch things for teaching Signs, as may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford and yield plentiful Inſtruction to his people.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then the Scripture ſpeaks of Fat in a good ſenſe. <hi>My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied a with marrow and fatneſs,</hi> Pſal. 63.5. That is, to be filled with the beſt things.</p>
               <p>So Iſai. 25.6. <hi>In this Mountain ſhall the Lord of Hoſts make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all people a Feaſt of fat things, a Feaſt of Wine on the Lees, of fat things full of marrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.18. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaith to <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren, <hi>ye ſhall eat the fat of the Land,</hi> that is, the beſt of it.</p>
               <p>So all the <hi>Fat</hi> of the Oyl, and all the <hi>Fat</hi> of the Wine, and of the Wheat, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.12. for ſo the Margin from the Hebrew reads: it denotes the beſt Oyl, the beſt Wine, the beſt Wheat, as the Tranſlation well explains it.</p>
               <p>Hence it is ſaid of <hi>Abel</hi> by way of Commendation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4. That he brought and offered unto the Lord of the Firſtlings of his Flock, and of the Fat thereof.</p>
               <p>Thus the Lords challenging the fat of all the Sacrifices peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly to himſelf, may inſtruct and teach us thus much: That we muſt ſerve God with the beſt we have, the beſt of our time and ſtrength, the vigor of our Spirits, the beſt of our endeavours ſhould be the Lords.</p>
               <p>For men to ſpend their youth in the ſervice of their luſts, and then at laſt bring their decrepit old age unto God; this is to give the fat of their Sacrifice to the Devil, and the lean unto God. But with ſuch Sacrifices God will not be well pleaſed.</p>
               <p>And yet when we have brought the Fat, the beſt we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:96313:155"/>
the Lord, it is accepted not for our own ſakes, but through Chriſt. As the Fat in the Peace-Offerings was burnt upon the Altar upon the Burnt-Offering, for a ſweet ſavour unto the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scripture ſometimes ſpeaks of Fat <hi>in deteriorem partem,</hi> in an evil ſenſe: ſo it is ſaid of wicked men, <hi>their heart is as fat as Greaſe, but I delight in thy Law.</hi> Pſal. 119.70. So Deut. 32.15. <hi>But</hi> Jeſurun <hi>waxed fat and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatneſs.</hi> Iſai. 6.10. <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, leſt they underſtand with their heart, and convert and be healed.</hi> So it denotes a ſenſeleſs hard heart, the Fat in the body having little ſenſe.</p>
               <p>A Fat heart in this ſenſe, is oppoſed to a fleſhy heart: ſo it denotes hardneſs, inſenſibleneſs, unbelief.</p>
               <p>Now then the Fat being burnt upon the Altar, teacheth us, That our Corruptions muſt be burnt up by the Spirit of God, as a Spirit of Burning, and of Judgment.</p>
               <p>And it is the Fat of the Inward parts, and of the Kidneys, and Liver, which are the ſeat of Luſt and Concupiſcence.</p>
               <p>We may learn from hence, that even ſecret ſins in the Inward parts muſt be deſtroyed and mortified. It is not enough to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void open and outward ſins, but inward heart hypocriſy; ſecret luſts, they muſt be burnt before the Lord upon the Altar, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and mortified by the Spirit. God trys the Heart, ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Reins, ſees into the Inward parts. That fatneſs of the heart muſt be conſumed, thoſe Inward luſtings unto ſin, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and mortified.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The laſt Ceremony was the forbidding of blood, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. This Prohibition was more general than the former of Fat: for that was only ſome kinds of Fat. But all manner of blood is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, without any reſtraint or ſpecification of this or that kind.</p>
               <p>The firſt Prohibition of blood that we read of in Scripture, was to <hi>Noahs</hi> Sons. Gen. 9.4. <hi>But fleſh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof ye ſhall not eat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now again by <hi>Moſes</hi> here, and afterwards in other places. As <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.26, 27. and <hi>Cap.</hi> 17. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, to the end: very largely and vehemently under the foreſt pains and penalties, even
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:96313:155"/>
utter extermination, and cutting off by the immediate hand of God.</p>
               <p>But that Prohibition in <hi>Noahs</hi> time, ſeems to differ from this by <hi>Moſes:</hi> in that it was living blood which was there forbidden: but here it is all manner of blood. As to the myſteries and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of it, there be two things expreſſed in <hi>Lev.</hi> 17.11.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the blood is the life of the Beaſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11, 14. That is, it is the Seat and Vehicle of the Spirits, which are the Soul and the Life of it, as Philoſophers ſay. <hi>Anima rationalis equitat in ſenſitivâ, ſenſitiva equitat in vegetativâ.</hi> The ſenſitive Soul is the Chariot of the rational Soul, and the vegetative of the ſenſitive: ſo their Blood is the Chariot of the vegetative and vital Spirits.</p>
               <p>The ſcope ſeems to be this, to forbid and prevent cruelty: it argues too much greedineſs, and it tends to make the Spirits of men ſalvag and barbarous, to drink living blood, or to eat the fleſh, if it be not fully killed and cleanſed of the blood, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.32, 33, 34.</p>
               <p>Some report, that it hath been a cuſtom uſed in ſome barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nations, amongſt the Old <hi>Tartarians:</hi> they would open a Vein with an Inſtrument in the Beaſt they rode upon, and ſo quench their thirſt by drinking warm blood out of the Veins of a living Creature. This is forbidden to <hi>Noahs</hi> Sons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. as a ſalvage cruel thing.</p>
               <p>Cruelty is abominable at all times, but eſpecially when you come with your Peace-Offerings before the Lord.</p>
               <p>It concerns you then eſpecially, to take heed of harſhneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your brethren.</p>
               <p>How can men expect Peace from God, when ready to drink the blood of their brethren.</p>
               <p>A violent perſecuting Spirit, is as black a Mark as any I know. To uſe violence to their Conſciences, this is to eat or drink their blood which God abhors.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond reaſon there aſſigned is, <hi>becauſe I have given it to you upon the Altar, to make an atonement for your Souls.</hi> Lev. 17.11. that is, typically, as repreſenting the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>So that here is a myſtical Intimation of reverence to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:96313:156"/>
blood, to keep men in a reverend expectation of it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt abſtain from blood, as ſacred to the Lord.</p>
               <p>As <hi>David</hi> refuſed to drink of the Waters of the Well of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.17. becauſe it was <hi>per equivalentiam,</hi> the blood of them that fetcht it with the peril of their Lives.</p>
               <p>So here, blood was typically the blood of Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſacred to the Lord, they muſt not uſe it to other common uſe.</p>
               <p>The Lord would hereby teach them a reverential eſteem and high valuation, of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Some go a little further, and obſerve this in it. That look as eating and drinking ſignifies Communion: ſo 1 Cor. 10.16. <hi>The Cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the blood of Chriſt?</hi> And forbidding to eat, is a forbidding Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.13, 14. In <hi>Peters</hi> Viſion, <hi>riſe, kill and eat.</hi> It is meant of exerciſing Communion with the Gentiles; and <hi>Peters</hi> objecting, <hi>Not ſo Lord, for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</hi> His meaning is, he refuſeth Communion with them.</p>
               <p>So this Prohibition of eating blood, which was given upon the Altar to make atonement for mens Souls; and of Fat, which was given upon the Altar to be conſumed there with Fire, and ſo was the Lords; ſeemeth to forbid figuratively, all aſcribing and aſſuming unto our ſelves the work of our Redemption, which is only by the blood of Chriſt, or the work of our Sanctification to our ſelves, which Chriſt by his Spirit performeth in us. <hi>Aynſw.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To take this work to our ſelves, is to eat the blood as it were, which the Lord will not endure.</p>
               <p>There is a further reaſon given by ſome, That the Lord did it, to diſtinguiſh his people from the Heathen, who were wont to drink the blood of their ſacrifices. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3.</p>
               <p>As indeed in all theſe ancient Inſtitutions, the Lord had a ſpecial eye unto that, to keep them off from the heatheniſh Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and Idolatries.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the reaſons why blood was forbidden under the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:96313:156"/>
Law, the chief whereof is, the reſpect it had to the blood of Chriſt. From all which, you have a clear reſolution of that ſcruple of Conſcience that hath troubled ſome, concerning that Prohibition of blood under the New Teſtament by the Synod, in <hi>Act.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>But the Anſwer is, That the main reaſon why blood was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden of old, being becauſe the Lord had given blood to them for atonement, and this uſe being figurative, which had its end and accompliſhment in Chriſt, who by his death and blood ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, hath cauſed the Sacrifices and Oblations to ceaſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Therefore now this Law muſt needs be expired, and not ſtill in force upon the Conſciences of Believers.</p>
               <p>And as for that Decree of the Council, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. It is forbidden by them meerly upon the account of love, which is tender and loth to give offenſe.</p>
               <p>The ſins there forbidden, may be referred to three Heads or Glaſſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sins againſt the firſt Table, eating things offered to Idols.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sins againſt the ſecond Table, againſt the ſeventh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, Fornication; becauſe it was a common ſin, and wherein the Heathen were very blind, ſome of them account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it but an indifferent thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sins againſt the general Rule of love to our brethren.</p>
               <p>Of this ſort is <hi>the eating of things ſtrangled, and blood,</hi> which had formerly been a ſin againſt the ſecond Commandment: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forbidden of old in the way of a perpetual Statute, during the whole legal Aeconomy. <hi>Lev.</hi> 17.15.</p>
               <p>That which dies of it ſelf, includes ſtrangled: for there is no other place in the Law that forbids the eating of things ſtrangled, but only this. And <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.21. where there is the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. But now the ſame thing is forbidden in a more occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional and temporary way, upon the account of ſcandal to ſincere but weak Believers. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13.</p>
               <p>And there was a further benefit of this Obſervation, in that juncture of time: for it did prevent and cut off all appearance and occaſion, for that Calumny, and falſe Aſperſion caſt forth by
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:96313:157"/>
the Pagans, in thoſe firſt times of Chriſtianity. That the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were wont to feed upon mans fleſh, and to drink blood in their Aſſemblies. <hi>Euſeb. Eccleſ. Hiſt. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Tertull. Apolog. cap.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>And though they are called neceſſary things; yet there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts and ways of neceſſity.</p>
               <p>As ſome things are neceſſary in their own nature, upon a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and perpetual account, as to avoid Idolatry and Fornication: ſo other things are neceſſary only <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> in regard of preſent Circumſtances; as to abſtain from blood, or from eating fleſh. As 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13.</p>
               <p>And though they are joyned with groſſer ſins; yet the ſame penalty and much more the ſame Prohibition, may be ſet upon things of a very different nature.</p>
               <p>As Death is the penalty of Murther. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6.</p>
               <p>And of having Leavened Bread. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.15, 19.</p>
               <p>It cannot poſſibly be the ſenſe of the Council, to forbid that kind of Meat as in it ſelf, and morally and perpetually unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: becauſe all difference of Meats, is moſt expreſly and clearly taken away under the New Teſtament. As <hi>Mark</hi> 7.14, to 20. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8. <hi>But meat commendeth us not to God, for neither if we eat, are we the better, neither if we eat not, are we the worſe.</hi> And 1 Cor. 10.25. <hi>Whatſoever is ſold in the Shambles, that eat, asking no queſtion for conſcience ſake.</hi> Tit. 1.15. <hi>To the pure, all things are pure.</hi> But in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5. the Apoſtle thunders againſt this Error, of making difference of Meats under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the nature of the Sacrifice of Peace-Offerings. Something will be expected, as to the practical Improvement of theſe Truths.</p>
               <p>Let me therefore only repeat and reinculcate ſome few of the general Heads of things, which have been doctrinally cleared and made out, I ſhall but touch them now in a more applicatory way.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then be perſwaded and encouraged, to feed and feaſt upon Chriſt our Peace-Offering. Do not ſay, ſuch and ſuch, may if
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:96313:157"/>
I had ſuch Parts and ſuch Abilities, and ſo Eminent as ſuch and ſuch, I durſt believe.</p>
               <p>This bleſſed Peace-Offering is not for the Prieſts only, for Saints of the higheſt Rank, and greateſt Eminency; but for the common people alſo. Do but draw neer with a pure heart, and then come and welcome: take your ſhare, and eat it with a glad heart, God hath given it you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do not defer the eating of your Peace Offerings: take heed of a procraſtinating Spirit. As many who think to repent and return to God when they are dying, and dropping into hell, whereas they ſhould eat the Peace-Offering, and eat it now.</p>
               <p>Do it to day before to morrow, or at leaſt before the third day: for rhen thy Peace Offering will not be accepted.</p>
               <p>Come in to God the third hour of the day, or if thou haſt loſt that ſeaſon, yet come in at the ſixth, the ninth, at leaſt at the eleventh hour of the day. If you ſtay till the Sun be ſet, and the day of the Lords patience run out, then your Peace Offerings ſhall not be accepted, then thy Faith, thy Repentance will not ſave thee.</p>
               <p>Oh! But I will cry God mercy, and truſt to Chriſt then.</p>
               <p>Ay but thy Conſcience then will ſay, you ſhould have eaten the Peace-Offering ſooner: eating it the third day ſhall not be accepted: nor will catching at Chriſt when thou art gone to hell. <hi>Oh then that thou hadſt known in this thy day, the things belonging to thy Peace!</hi> Luk. 19.42.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let all your Peace-Offerings be ſeaſoned with the new Leaven of Grace and Holineſs; get this bleſſed Leaven of the Kingdom of God into your hearts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Give God the fat, the ſtrength, the vigor of your Spirits, the beſt of your endeavours; do not leave the worſt you have to him, the very dregs of time at night, when you are all drowſy and ſleepy, for prayer and family duties, when you have ſpent the ſtrength of your time in your Callings. Reſerve ſome of your good hours for God, and duties of Communion with him. With ſuch drowſy Sacrifices God will not be well pleaſed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Take heed of accounting the blood of the Peace Offering
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:96313:158"/>
a common thing. But as the typical blood might not be eaten, but was ſacred to the Lord: let the blood of Chriſt be ſacred and precious to you.</p>
               <p>It is a dreadful ſin <hi>to count the blood wherewith you are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a common thing.</hi> Heb. 10.</p>
               <p>Oh this contempt of Chriſt, contempt of the Goſpel, of thoſe glad tydings, and of that Soul Redeeming blood! <hi>That ſoul ſhall be cut off from his people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To you that believe he is precious;</hi> there is a reverential eſteem of him, in the hearts of all that are his: they dare not arrogate nor medle with that which is his peculiar Glory, and aſſume their Salvation to themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts will ſay they are ſaved by Chriſt; but how? Why, through the blood of Chriſt, but how come they to be made partakers of him? Why God foreſees that they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe, and ſo ordains them to life upon the foreſight of what they will do. And thus they do as it were, devour the blood of the Peace-Offering, and deſtroy the Glory they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and ſeem to give to him.</p>

               <p>THis is the fourth of thoſe ſix kinds of legal Sacrifices, which are handled and directed in the ſeven firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Book.</p>

               <p>The ſixth is <hi>Milluim,</hi> the Offering of Conſecrations.</p>
               <p>As to this fourth namely the Sin-Offering; many of the Laws and Rites thereof are the ſame with other Sacrifices, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular with the Burnt-Offering, which is the firſt, and where the common Rites are firſt mentioned, and accordingly were there explained.</p>
               <p>As for Inſtance, the mater of this, is the ſame with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sacrifices before explained.</p>
               <p>The general end and uſe, is the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> for Atonement and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:96313:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Expiation of ſin, which is mentioned and repeated four times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in this Chapter, verſ. 20, 26, 31, 35. <hi>And the Prieſt ſhall make an atonement for him, for the ſin that he hath committed, and it ſhall be forgiven him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover as to the ſacred Rites and Ceremonies, there be many of them which are the ſame in the Sin-Offering, with what was before ordained in the Burnt-Offering, and in the Peace-Offering: as that it muſt be brought to the door of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Congregation, the Offerer muſt lay his hand upon it; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it muſt be killed and burnt, at leaſt in part upon the Altar, thoſe parts of it which were to be ſo dealt with in the Peace-Offering. The Myſteries of all which have been formerly explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Therefore all that remains is, that we ſpeak a word to thoſe things which are more ſpecial and peculiar to the Sin-Offering, and they are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſpecial end of it <hi>viz.</hi> for ſins of infirmity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The various and fourfold appointment of the matter of it, for four ſorts of ſinners, to wit, the Prieſt, the body of the people, the civil Ruler, and any private perſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The threefold diſpoſal of the blood of it; part to be ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in or towards the Holy of Holies, part to be put upon the Horns of the Altar of Incenſe, and part to be poured forth at the bottom of the Brazen Altar of Burnt-Offerings.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The burning it without the Camp, with the Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies thereto belonging.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The eating another part in ſome caſes, with the ſacred Rites thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſpecial end of it, and ſo the difference between this and other Sacrifices, eſpecially the Treſpaſs-Offering which comes neareſt to it, and hath moſt affinity with it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>The general end, is atonement or expiation of ſin; but the queſtion is for what kind of ſin?</p>
               <p>I confeſs there is much difficulty as to this.</p>
               <p>I have made ſome ſearch into divers Authors and Writers about it, and have not met with that clearneſs and full ſatisfaction that were to be deſired, and which is to be found in other things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:96313:159"/>Therefore I ſhall but tell you my own judgment of it in a few words.</p>
               <p>The Sin Offering may be taken either in a larger ſenſe, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Treſpaſs Offering; or in a ſtraiten ſenſe, as contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed to it.</p>
               <p>Take it in the largeſt ſenſe, and ſo it extends to any ſin what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that is pardonable; and thus the Sin Offering is a <hi>genus</hi> including two <hi>ſpecies,</hi> namely, the Sin Offering ſtrictly taken, and the Treſpaſs Offering.</p>
               <p>Thus it is oppoſed only to preſumptuous ſinning, which had no Sacrifice provided for it in the Law: for ſuch perſons were to be cut off. And of this ſenſe, and this oppoſition <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. ſpeaketh clearly; ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 27, 28, 29. compare this with <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. There is a way of ſinning for which there is no forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p>Thus <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are oppoſed.</p>
               <p>Of the latter the Apoſtle ſaith, Heb. 10.26. <hi>There remaineth no more Sacrifice for ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there be other ſins which though againſt knowledg, yet are not preſumptuous to ſuch an height; but the Soul is carried aſide out of ignorance and ſurprize, and by the violence of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and of ſinful paſſions and duſts, through inadvertency, careleſneſs, unadviſedneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For theſe there is a Sin Offering.</p>
               <p>In this ſenſe, even the Treſpaſs-Offering is and may be called a Sin Offering, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. See <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>But take it in a more narrow ſenſe as contradiſtinguiſhed unto the Treſpaſs Offering, and here lyes the difficulty, wherein the Sin Offering (whoſe Rites and Laws are here ſet down in this 4. Chapter) wherein doth it differ from the Treſpaſs-Offering in the 5. Chapter, as to the ſpecial end and uſe of it?</p>
               <p>Some have thought the Sin-Offering refers to ſins of Omiſſion, the Treſpaſs-Offering to ſins of Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>But this Rule will not hold; for the Treſpaſs Offering concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſins of Omiſſion, as well as the other. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5.1. <hi>If he do not utter it, when he ought to do it.</hi> Here is an omiſſion, for which a Treſpaſs-Offering is there appointed.</p>
               <p>Some have thought that the Sin Offering was for ſins againſt
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:96313:160"/>
the ſecond Table, and the Treſpaſs-Offering for ſins againſt the firſt.</p>
               <p>But the Text is clear, That the Treſpaſs-Offering relates both to firſt and ſecond Table ſins, ſuch as deceit and violence to his neighbour, as well as perjury againſt God. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.2. <hi>If a Soul ſin and commit a Treſpaſs againſt the Lord, and lye unto his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Others have ſtated it thus, That there is <hi>ignorantia facti,</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Fact in the one, and <hi>ignorantia juris,</hi> ignorance of the Rule in the other.</p>
               <p>But this is a notion that hath no footing in the Text.</p>
               <p>But the true difference between them conſiſts, as I conceive, in this. That the Sin-Offering was for ſins of ignorance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity: but the Treſpaſs-Offering did extend even to ſins againſt knowledg.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons for this, are partly from the propriety of the Hebrew words, and partly from ſome expreſſions in the Text.</p>
               <p>The Hebrew word for the Sin-Offering <hi>Chattaah,</hi> from <hi>chata peccare,</hi> which properly ſignifies to miſs the Mark a man ſhoots at. <hi>Proprie eſt errare, vel aberrare à Scopo.</hi> Buxtorf.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Judg.</hi> 20.16. the ſeven hundred choſen men of <hi>Benjamin</hi> it is ſaid, they could ſling ſtones at an hair breadth and not miſs. <hi>Velo jacte nec aberrabat</hi> and not ſin, that is, miſs of the Scope and Mark they intended and propoſed to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Hence God is ſaid to reduce ſinners, that is, ſuch as go aſtray and miſs their way, into the way again. Pſal. 25.8. <hi>Good and upright is the Lord, therefore will he teach ſinners in the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Conjugation <hi>Pihel,</hi> it ſignifies to purge and cleanſe from ſin, by making ſatisfaction and undergoing the penalty due to it. As Exod. 29.36. <hi>and thou ſhalt cleanſe the Altar, ve chit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetha yal hamisbeach</hi>— Lev. 14.52. <hi>he ſhall cleanſe the houſe, vechitte eth habajith.</hi> Gen. 31.39. Jacob <hi>ſaith to</hi> Laban, <hi>that which is torn of Beaſts I brought not unto thee, I bare the loſs of it. Anoki achattinah, ego expiabam illud. Arias Montanus,</hi> I expiated it. <hi>Poenas luebam pro eo, ſo</hi> Pagnin. <hi>Buxtorf.</hi> I ſuffered for it.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the proper importance of the word here uſed and tranſlated, the Sin-Offering <hi>Chattaah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:96313:160"/>Moreover the Text ſaith upon the Sin-Offering. That if a Soul err and miſs it thus, <hi>Biſhgagah</hi> through error or ignorance, which further clears up the true ſenſe. Pſal. 119.67. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray;</hi> it is the ſame word <hi>ani ſhogeg, ego errans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the word which is uſed for the Treſpaſs-Offering <hi>Aſham,</hi> though it is uſed for ſin in general, yet it ſeems to imply in a more ſpecial ſenſe ſins of an higher nature, ſuch as are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with more deliberation, or with more conſent of will, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt more light, or with leſs of temptation, or more of injury unto others, ſins of a more grievous and heinous nature: for the ſame word ſignifies alſo deſolation and laying waſte. Iſai. 24.6. <hi>therefore hath the Curſe devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are deſolate, vajeſhmu.</hi> And in the ſame ſenſe is this word uſed elſewhere, <hi>e. g.</hi> Pſal. 5.10. <hi>deſtroy them O God, deſolato eos tanquam reos,</hi> Buxtorf.</p>
               <p>Moreover there be Inſtances given here in the Treſpaſs Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of groſs ſins againſt light and knowledg, conſcience-waſting, ſoul-deſolating ſins, as lying, cheating, perjury, <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.2, 3. And we may therefore render <hi>Aſham piaculum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The iſſue then is this, That the Sin Offering relates to thoſe involuntary infirmities which are unavoidable, while there is a body of ſin and death dwelling in us, and which are conſiſtent with aſſurance and ſincerity.</p>
               <p>But the Treſpaſs-Offering, to thoſe greater conſcience waſting and ſoul-deſolating ſins, which are inconſiſtent with aſſurance and true Communion with God, though it includes ſome leſſer ſins, yet it extends to theſe alſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Law of the Sin-Offering is this, That there is a various matter of this Offering, for four ſorts of perſons that ſin and miſs the way, which indeed are the Analyſis of this Chapter.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. For the anointed Prieſt <hi>a young Bullock,</hi> verſ. 3.</item>
                  <item>2. For the whole Congregation <hi>a young Bullock,</hi> verſ. 13.</item>
                  <item>3. For the Ruler <hi>a Kid of the Goats, a Male without blemiſh,</hi> verſ. 22.</item>
                  <item>4. For any particular perſon <hi>a Kid, or elſe a Lamb, a Female
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:96313:161"/>
without blemiſh.</hi> verſ. 27. And ſo the Chapter divides it ſelf into theſe four parts.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The Sin Offering for the anointed Prieſt is <hi>a young Bullock,</hi> &amp;c. verſ. 3, to 13.</p>
               <p>There is ſome difficulty upon this. Who is meant by the anointed Prieſt? Some reſtrain it to the High Prieſt only, becauſe none but he was anointed with material Oyl.</p>
               <p>The word in the Text is <hi>Hachohen hammaſhiach, the Prieſt that is anointed.</hi> verſ. 3.</p>
               <p>But if this be reſtrained to the High Prieſt only, the queſtion will be, what ſhall become of the other inferior Prieſts? Is there no Sin Offering? Is there no Expiation for their ſins and ſailings? Doubtleſs there is.</p>
               <p>But we cannot well refer them amongſt the common people of the Land, the Prieſts and people being ſo continually diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every where throughout the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Therefore it ſeems more congruous to conceive (as ſome do) that all the Prieſts are here included, and that the word anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed intends no more but dedicated, conſecrated, ſet apart unto that work and office: or that it may refer to that firſt Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them in <hi>Aaron</hi> their Fore-father. Exod. 29.7. <hi>And thou ſhalt take the anointing Oyl, and pour it upon his head and anoint him.</hi> The Law is, if he ſhall ſin <hi>le aſhamath hyam</hi> according to the ſin of the people, as our Tranſlation renders it, that is, like one of the common people. For the Prieſts were not made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, or impeccable by their Office; and therefore had need to offer for their own ſins, as well as for the peoples. <hi>Heb</hi> 5.2, 3.</p>
               <p>It is not to be reſtrained only to ſuch ſins of his, as wherein he ſeduceth and draws the people aſide to ſin with him, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he brings publick Judgments upon them, as ſome have rendred it, <hi>ſi delinquere fecerit populum;</hi> and others, <hi>ſi deliquerit in populi noxam.</hi> For then here were no relief for him, as to all his other failings in the diſcharge and execution of his truſt and office in the houſe of God, and in his own private and perſonal walkings.</p>
               <p>Therefore it muſt be underſtood in the largeſt and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive ſenſe, for any ſin or failing of weakneſs in any of the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:96313:161"/>
Prieſts. <hi>Let him bring a young Bullock for his Sin Offering.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For the whole Congregation <hi>a Bullock,</hi> verſ. 13. the whole body of the people collectively taken: the ſame that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Prieſt, though with ſome difference in the Rites. There the Prieſt, but here the Elders as in the name of the people, being to lay their hands upon the Head of the Sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the Ruler <hi>a Kid, a Male,</hi> verſ. 22. <hi>Naſi, Princeps, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi elatus ſuper alios;</hi> from <hi>Naſa, exaltavit, tulit,</hi> that is, any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Ruler that is raiſed or lifted up above others.</p>
               <p>The word is uſed, not only concerning Kings and chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.24. but concerning inferior Rulers alſo; Exod. 16.22. <hi>And all the Rulers of the Congregation came and told</hi> Moſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Numb. 16.2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For any of the common people, their Sin Offering is <hi>a Kid, a Female,</hi> verſ. 27. or elſe <hi>a Lamb, a Female,</hi> verſ. 32, to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>Now from this ſecond Law of the Sin-Offering, namely, this various matter of it for ſo many ſorts of perſons that ſin: we may learn theſe Inſtructions before we proceed to the third Law.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the anointed Prieſt may err. Therefore the <hi>Biſhop of Rome</hi> if he were an Officer of Chriſt, he might err and miſs his Mark: though being Antichriſt, it may be granted to him that he ſeldom errs from his Scope, it being to promote the Devils Kingdom, and to obſtruct the Kingdom, and oppreſs the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs I have wondred at this error of Popery, that the Pope cannot err: I wonder, why he may not err in Doctrine, as well as in life? Why may he not deny God in words, as well as in his works?</p>
               <p>That he may and doth err in his life, and that his works are evil, themſelves have not the impudence to deny: therefore he may err in his Faith, as well as in his life; in his words, as well as in his works.</p>
               <p>And if you do but look into a weekly News book, you will ever and anon find mention of the <hi>Popes Nephews,</hi> what they do, and what preferments he provides for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:96313:162"/>But who are theſe? It is fit you ſhould know the meaning of it.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Nephew,</hi> it is an <hi>Italian Phraſe of Speech for a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard:</hi> and ſo indeed the <hi>Popes Nephewes,</hi> is nothing elſe but the <hi>Popes Baſtards:</hi> this is he that cannot err.</p>
               <p>Among the Papiſts, Prieſts you know muſt not marry: and the Pope is not ſo humble as to own others of his poor Kindred.</p>
               <p>But yet we muſt believe in this unclean Beaſt, and we muſt call him his Holineſs forſooth, whoſe Leproſy is written in his Forehead, and who declares his ſin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and hides it not as <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> For they are not aſhamed of all their uncleanneſſes and abominations, having their Conſciences ſeared with an hot Iron; and yet this ſinful doleful Creature cannot err, when his Bones are full of the ſins of his youth, which ſhall ly down with him in the duſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Inſtruction is this, That there are degrees of ſin, and that the ſins and errors of an anointed Prieſt, are of the worſt and greateſt guilt. This is here taught and held forth both by the Matter of the Sin-Offering, and by the Rites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it.</p>
               <p>As to the Matter, the Prieſt muſt have as great a Sacrifice for a Sin Offering, as the whole body of the people collectively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. A young Bullock is the Sin-Offering for the Prieſt, and it is no more but a young Bullock for the whole Congregation.</p>
               <p>And there is a difference as to the Rites for the ſeveral ſorts of ſinners; for the Sin-Offering for the Prieſt, and for the body of the people, was to be ſprinkled before the Vail, and upon the Altar of Incenſe.</p>
               <p>But that for the Ruler, and for private perſons, were not ſprinkled before the Vail, nor upon the Incenſe Altar, but only upon the Altar of Burnt-Offering, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25, 30, 34. For the ſins of the Prieſt and of the whole Congregation, as being more hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, required a more ſolemn manner of atonement; ſo our Annotators on <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.25.</p>
               <p>It was an error of the Stoick Philoſophers of old, that <hi>peccata ſunt aequalia,</hi> all ſins are equal. It is true, ſin is a privation, but there are degrees in Privations; there be total and partial priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:96313:162"/>
As in the Twilight and dim ſightedneſs, every ſin deviates and ſwerves from the rule of Righteouſneſs. But there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of rectitude and curvity; ſome crooked lines depart fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off from the ſtrait line, and ſome come nearer to it: ſo it is in ſins.</p>
               <p>The ſins of a Miniſter do receive peculiar aggravations, and are greater in many reſpects, then the ſins of other men. For them to be covetous and greedy after the world, for them to be of an unbrotherly impoſing ſpirit, that is, ambitious and contentious, it is worſe then in other men: and that eſpecially in two reſpects, which are both hinted in the Text.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe of their <hi>anointing</hi> or ſeparation unto Office, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſtand nearer to God than others do, being <hi>to miniſter to him in his holy things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe their ſins and errors, have uſually a very pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous influence upon the people, either to ſeduce or ſcandalize them. Many will be ready to follow their pernicious ways.</p>
               <p>Hence ſome read and underſtand the words, verſ. 3. <hi>If he ſin, to cauſe the people to err, or to bring publick Judgments upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence many are ſo apt to plead; ſuch a Miniſter thinks it lawful, and ſuch a one does it, and why may not I?</p>
               <p>See 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.17, 24. how the ſins of Miniſters do ſcandalize the people, cauſing them to tranſgreſs ſome of them in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and others to abhor and deſpiſe the Ordinances of the Lord: and this makes Miniſters ſins great before the Lord.</p>
               <p>But people ſhould conſider that an anointed Prieſt may ſin and err, and their Errors oftentimes do much hurt. This is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Inſtruction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The whole Church may err, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>This is another Aſſertion of the Papiſts, That their Church cannot err: a ſtrange and wonderful Aſſertion. Did not the whole Church err, when they crucified Chriſt? And they did err fundamentally; yet the <hi>Jews</hi> were then the only true Church and people of God in the world.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is very unſafe to pin your Faith upon the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Sleeve, or upon the Miniſters Sleeve either: for both Church and Miniſter may err.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:96313:163"/>It is not ſafe to be led meerly by multitude or by example. Exod. 23.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil, neither ſhalt thou ſpeak in a Cauſe to decline after many to wreſt Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, a true Church may in time err ſo farr, and degenerate ſo deeply, as that they may ceaſe to be a Church.</p>
               <p>As the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> for Inſtance. The Lord hath ſaid unto the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as he threatned by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea, Lo-ruhamah</hi> and <hi>Lo-ammi. I will not have mercy on you; and you are not my people.</hi> Hoſ. 1.6, 9. And Cap. 2.2. <hi>Plead with your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, plead: for ſhe is not my Wife, neither am I her Husband.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church of the two Tribes alſo, are now in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with the other ten. Zech. 11.10. <hi>And I took my Staff, even Beauty, and cut it aſunder, that I might break my Covenant which I had made with all the people.</hi> The meaning is, that he would diſcovenant and unchurch them; but yet he will at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them.</p>
               <p>But would you ſee an Inſtance of a Church which God hath rejected and unchurched, and which ſhall never be reſtored any more.</p>
               <p>Behold the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome; it was once a true Church, and the Paſtor thereof a true Miniſter, when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes</hi> ſixteen hundred years ago: but now, ſo far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined from their firſt eſtate, and from the primitive and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Pattern, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is become the Whore of</hi> Babylon, <hi>and the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>the Head of that Church, is Antichriſt.</hi> See <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. They are ſet forth under the notion of two wild and venemous Beaſts; the firſt Beaſt in that Chapter which hath ten Horns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome; the ſecond Beaſt with two Horns, is the <hi>Pope of</hi> Rome: the firſt is <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, they have erred ſo farr, that (except the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they crucified Jeſus Chriſt) I think there was never any Church that erred ſo much, as this Church that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends they cannot err.</p>

upon the peoples Offering.</hi> Verſ. 15. That is, as their Agents and Repreſentatives.</p>
               <p>The people are not to think themſelves meerly paſſive, in what their Elders and Rulers do: no, believe it, you are more concerned then ſo.</p>
               <p>Their act involves the people, which gives a juſt account of Gods ſending publick Calamities upon the people, for the ſins of their Rulers: for what the Parliament do, the people do.</p>
               <p>The method of Providence is often thus. Firſt the people they ſin, and provoke God to anger, then he leaves their Rulers to ſin for their ſakes, and then comes Wrath. For while there is <hi>a Phinehas, a Joſiah,</hi> they ſtand in the gap, and ſtave off publick Judgments it may be all their days: but when they are gone, or if they ſin too, this opens a gap for publick Judgments to break in upon the people See 2 Sam. 24.1. <hi>And again the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and he moved</hi> David <hi>againſt them to ſay, go number</hi> Iſrael <hi>and</hi> Judah.</p>
               <p>Obſerve the method; firſt God is angry with <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their ſins, then he moved <hi>David</hi> their King to ſin, and then comes the Plague.</p>
               <p>People are very apt when things go amiſs, and the publick affairs do not proſper, they are very apt to be diſcontent with their Rulers and Magiſtrates, and to ſay, that it is their fault. But if they do amiſs, you ſhould conſider why God leaves them to it: it is often for the ſins of the people.</p>
               <p>It would better become private perſons to reflect upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and upon their own ſins; and their own unworthineſs, then to work out in diſcontent againſt thoſe that God hath ſet over them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Law of the Sin-Offering is, concerning the blood thereof. There is a threefold diſpoſal of it appointed by the Rule in this Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Prieſt is to dip his finger in the blood, and to ſprinkle it ſeven times before the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is to put part of it upon the four Horns of the golden Altar of Incenſe.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:96313:164"/>3. He is to pour out the reſt of it at the bottom of the Brazen Altar of Burnt-Offering. Of theſe three Ceremonies, a few words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Prieſt is to dip his finger in the blood, and to ſprinkle it ſeven times before the Lord, that is, before the Vail of the Sanctuary towards the Holy of Holies. Upon the great day of Expiation, he was to ſprinkle it within the Vail; but becauſe he was not to enter into that Holy place every day, but only once a year; therefore at other times he did but ſprinkle it towards the holy place, upon or towards the Vail; ſee <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.14. But the ſignification was the ſame in both.</p>
               <p>It teacheth us three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is no entrance into Heaven, but by the blood of Chriſt ſhed and poured forth, and ſprinkled and applied effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. For the place within the Vail, the Holy of Holies was a Type of Heaven, and the Prieſt entred there not without blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11, 12, 24, 25, 26.</p>
               <p>Heaven is a Poſſeſſion purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. We enter into the Holieſt by the blood of Jeſus. We had never come there, had not the blood of the Sin Offering been ſprinkled there for us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a full and perfect cleanſing in the blood of Chriſt; for he is to ſprinkle it ſeven times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seven</hi> is a number of perfection; becauſe in <hi>ſeven days</hi> the Creation of the world was finiſhed, and God reſted from his works.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>ſeven</hi> is a myſtical number, often uſed in Myſteries throughout the Scripture, both in typical, and in prophetical places. <hi>Vid.</hi> Aynſw. <hi>in loc.</hi>

In the Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> the Lamb that was ſtain, which is Jeſus Chriſt, is repreſented with <hi>ſeven</hi> Horns, to ſignify the perfection of his Power; and with <hi>ſeven</hi> Eyes, to ſhew the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Wiſdom: and the <hi>ſeven</hi> Spirits of God, the Holy Ghoſt in the perfection of all gifts and graces. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.6.</p>
               <p>There be alſo <hi>ſeven</hi> Candleſticks, <hi>ſeven</hi> Churches. And indeed the whole Book doth analyſe and divide it ſelf into three <hi>ſevens: ſeven</hi> Seals, <hi>ſeven</hi> Trumpets, and <hi>ſeven</hi> Vials.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſeven</hi> Seals, holding forth the ſtate of the Church under heatheniſh perſecution, with the iſſue thereof in the three firſt Centuries.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſeven</hi> Trumpets under Antichriſt, and other inteſtine troubles.</p>
               <p>And then finally, <hi>ſeven</hi> Vials of Wrath for the ruine of Anti-chriſt and other enemies, for the Churches proſperity.</p>
               <p>From all which, you ſee that there is ſomething of myſtery in the number of <hi>ſeven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in this Ceremony, it teacheth us the full and perfect cleanſing and atonement we have in the blood of Chriſt; and that our ſins need much cleanſing, much purgation. Heb. 9.13, 14. Heb. 10.14. <hi>For by one Offering, he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We may learn further, that ſprinkling is ſignificative enough of the ſpiritual cleanſing and perfect virtue that is in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt. For the Prieſt was not to pour out the blood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Vail, nor to waſh the Vail in the blood, but only <hi>to dip his finger, and ſo to ſprinkle the Vail with it.</hi> Iſai. 52.15. 1 Pet. 1.2. Heb. 12.24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another part of the blood was to be put upon the Horns of the Golden Altar of Incenſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. And again <hi>verſ.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>So in the Sin-Offering upon the great day of Expiation, <hi>Lev,</hi> 17.18, 19. this was uſed only in the Sin Offering of Bullocks: but in the Sin-Offering of Kids or Lambs, it was only poured and ſprinkled upon the Brazen-Altar, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25, 30, 34.</p>
               <p>The myſtery of this Ceremony was this, That Chriſts Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:96313:165"/>
is founded in his own blood and ſatisfaction. For the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe Altar was a Type of Prayer: he prays in the virtue of his own blood and ſufferings, and by the merit thereof, he prevails with God for us.</p>
               <p>And it is upon the ſame account, that our prayers alſo do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail and find acceptance with the Lord; it is becauſe the Incenſe Altar is ſprinkled with blood. We pray in his Name, and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire nothing in our prayers, but what he hath deſerved and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by his merits. See. Rev. 8.3. <hi>There was given him much Incenſe, that he ſhould offer it with the prayers of all Saints upon the Golden Altar.</hi> And 9.13. <hi>I heard a voice from the four Horns of the Golden Altar.</hi> The Golden Altar is the Altar of Incenſe: a voice is heard from thence as in anſwer to prayer.</p>
               <p>But did ever any Chriſtian pray for the coming in of the <hi>Turks</hi> upon the Chriſtian world? No, but God anſwers the prayers of his people oftentimes, by wonderful and terrible things in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.5. The moſt dreadful Revolutions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, are in anſwer to prayer: and that which makes pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſo powerful, is becauſe the Altar of Incenſe is ſprinkled with the blood of the Sin Offering.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The reſt of the blood, was to be poured forth at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Altar of Burnt-Offering; <hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 18, 25, 30, 34.</p>
               <p>This inſtructs us, that Chriſt was conſecrated and dedicated unto God in his own blood.</p>
               <p>The effuſion of the blood of Chriſt, as a Sin-Offering to the Juſtice of God for us, for our Salvation, for the purchaſe of the pardon of our ſins, and the relation of that blood to the Altar of his Deity, are here taught. But this was opened before when we were upon the Burnt-Offering. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p>But conſider this, as in conjunction with the former; the blood was ſprinkled both upon the holieſt of all, and upon the Altar of Incenſe, and now the reſt poured forth by the Altar of Burnt-Offering.</p>
               <p>It teacheth us, That the blood of Chriſt hath an influence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the concernments of our Salvation, from firſt to laſt.</p>
               <p>Exerciſe Faith in that blood upon all occaſions, and for all the concernments of your Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:96313:165"/>Would you ſee your ſins forgiven, and atonement made? See and take notice of that blood in the effuſion of it, as poured forth at the bottom of the Altar.</p>
               <p>Would you ſee your prayers accepted and anſwered? See the blood upon the Horns of the Incenſe-Altar.</p>
               <p>Would you ſee Heaven Gates opened, and way made for you into the Holy of Holies, an abundant entrance opened for you into Heaven? See the blood ſprinkled before the Vail.</p>
               <p>See the blood of Jeſus Chriſt influencing all the concernments of your Souls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Law of the Sin-Offering, is concerning the burning of it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. And again <hi>verſ.</hi> 19, 20, 21.</p>
               <p>The inward parts of it were to be burnt upon the Altar, as in the Ordinance of the Peace-Offering.</p>
               <p>All the reſt; the whole Bullock was to be burnt in a clean place without the Camp.</p>
               <p>This Law is peculiar to the Sin-Offering of a Bullock, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Prieſt, or for the whole Church.</p>
               <p>But in the Sin-Offering of Goats or Sheep for the Ruler, and for any individual of the common people, this Ceremony of burning without the Camp was not required.</p>
               <p>There is this reaſon given for burning the whole Sin Offering if it were a Bullock, and not allowing any of it to be eaten; namely, becauſe the blood of it was brought into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, to reconcile withal in the holy place. <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.30.</p>
               <p>You may ſee the practice of this Ceremony in the Sin Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at the Conſecration of the Prieſts. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.14.</p>
               <p>And as it was burnt without the Camp in their preſent unfix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed poſture: ſo when the Temple was fixed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it was burnt without the Gates of the City.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle explains it at large, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. and educeth three great Goſpel Truths and Myſteries out of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they which ſerve the Tabernacle, have no right to eat of our Altar under the Goſpel, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. Our New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Altar is Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:96313:166"/>To eat of the Altar, is to partake of the Offerings offered upon it.</p>
               <p>They that ſerve the Tabernacle, that is, the old worldly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, ſuch as ſerve that, that is, ſuch as adhere ſtill to legal ways and Obſervations, have no right to Chriſt the Altar, and to the Sacrifice he hath offered, and to Salvation by him.</p>
               <p>Such as cleave to their own Righteouſneſs, and to their own Wiſdom in the things of God, they deprive themſelves of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the Sin Offering was burnt without the Camp where they did caſt forth the Aſhes: ſo Chriſt ſuffered without the Gates of the City. <hi>They carried him out of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to</hi> Golgotha, <hi>to the place of dead mens Sculls.</hi> Mat. 27.33. <hi>And when they were come unto a place called</hi> Golgotha, <hi>that is to ſay, a place of a Skull, which is called</hi> Luk. 23.33. <hi>Calvary.</hi> That as it is ſaid of the Sin-Offering in the place where they pour out the Aſhes, there ſhall it be burnt, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.12. So Chriſt ſuffered <hi>without the Gate.</hi> Heb: 13.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Ceremony teacheth alſo the myſtery of our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt, in bearing his Reproach. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.13.</p>
               <p>For it was becauſe ſin was upon the Offering, which carries ſhame along with it, that it was carried forth.</p>
               <p>Malefactors were to be put to death without the Camp, ſo the Blaſphemer, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.14. ſo the preſumptuous Profaner of the Sabbaoth, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.35.</p>
               <p>If you cannot be content to bear the diſgraces and reproaches of the world, to be accounted a ſimple Heretick, a Fanatick, no true Son of the Church; but a Schiſmatick againſt the Church, and a Rebel againſt the King, an enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for ſo they ſaid of Chriſt; you refuſe to go forth with him out of the Camp, bearing his reproach.

their Fathers to the falſe Prophets.</hi> Luk. 6.26. To theſe add,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas he that did perform this Miniſtration about the Sin-Offering, was to be unclean until the Even: ſo in the Sin-Offering of the yearly Feaſt of Expiation. <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.27, 28.</p>
               <p>The ſame Law we find concerning the red Heifer, whereof they made the water of ſeparation. Numb. 18.9 <hi>And he that burneth her, ſhall waſh his Cloaths in water, and bath his Fleſh in water, and ſhall be unclean until the Even.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereby was ſhadowed forth, not only the imperfection of the legal Prieſthood and Miniſtrations, in that the Prieſts themſelves which prepared the Means of Sanctification for the Church, were themſelves polluted in the preparing and doing of them: ſo <hi>Ainſw.</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.8, 9.</p>
               <p>But it may inſtruct us alſo in a more general Truth, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Iniquity of our holy Offerings, our beſt duties and ſervices.</p>
               <p>There is ſomething of ſecret ſpiritual defilement cleaving to them, even when we are making our Peace with God; when we are atoneing, or receiving the Atonement, and acting about it. <hi>Lava lachrymas meas Domine;</hi> Lord, waſh even my tears.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The laſt Law of the Sin-Offering, is concerning the eating of it: of this ſee <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 24, to the end.</p>
               <p>This did not concern thoſe Sin Offerings, whoſe blood was brought into the holy place, and whoſe fleſh was burnt without the Camp, but only the Sin-Offerings of the Ruler and private perſons: as <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.30.</p>
               <p>There be three Ceremonial Laws and Ordinances about this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Prieſts are <hi>to eat it in the holy place,</hi> verſ. 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> expoſtulates with <hi>Aaron</hi> for the neglect of this, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.19, 20. And he there hinteth at ſome part of the myſtery of it, <hi>verſ</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>The Prieſt by eating the Sinners Offering, did typically bear the iniquity of the Sinner, and ſo aboliſh it as in a figure. It holds forth our Communion with Chriſt our Sin-Offering, as the Food of our Souls, whom by Faith we eat and feed upon. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.56.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Whatſoever ſhall touch the fleſh thereof ſhall be holy.</hi> verſ. 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:96313:167"/>This Rite was peculiar to the Sin-Offering: and ſeeing the Sin-Offering was a Type of Chriſt who was made ſin for us: This teacheth us the holineſs that ſhould be in them, who have any thing to do with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>God reproves the Prieſts, as Hoſ. 4.8. <hi>they eat up the ſin,</hi> or the Sin Offering, <hi>Chattaah, of my people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The old Note is this, the Prieſts ſeek to eat the peoples Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and flatter them in their ſins.</p>
               <p>Every one of us ſhould know <hi>how to poſſeſs our Veſſels in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and honour.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Veſſel wherein it is boyled, muſt be cleanſed by rinſing with Water, or by breaking it in pieces.</hi> Verſ. 27, 28. The like <hi>Levit.</hi> 11.32, 33. and 15.12.</p>
               <p>The earthen Veſſels were to be broken, in regard of the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them, the loſs would not be great: the more coſtly to be ſcoured and rinſed. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of thoſe (<hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10.) divers Waſhings and carnal Ordinances, impoſed on them till the time of Reformation.</p>
               <p>The Phariſees in ſuch Obſervations as theſe, went beyond the Rule, (as Superſtition is apt to do:) but Chriſt ſeverely rebukes them for their high ſtrains of ſuperſtitious Devotion. <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.4, 8.</p>
               <p>But out of Gods Inſtitution here, we may ſpell this leſſon of ſpiritual Inſtruction, namely, the ſtrange defilement and deep contagion and pollution that is in ſin, that there is ſo much ado for the cleanſing of it: and what care there ſhould be to purge and cleanſe our ſelves from it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 22— 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.</p>
               <p>And to make it out a little more particularly.</p>
               <p>If you would find out the meaning of a Type, it is a good Rule to obſerve the Scripture uſe of the ſame word, in the way of a Metaphor and alluſion.</p>
               <p>Now we find both wicked men and good men compared to earthen Veſſels. It is a Metaphor concerning wicked men, and the breaking is the deſtroying them. <hi>Jer.</hi> 19.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.38. God will break wicked men and unclean perſons with utter deſtruction, as Veſſels wherein is no pleaſure.</p>
               <p>But good men alſo are called earthen Veſſels, and ſo the Type
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:96313:167"/>
muſt be accommodated a little otherwiſe. 2 Cor. 4.7. <hi>We have this Treaſure in earthen Veſſels.</hi> And ſo the cleanſing theſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels by waſhing with water, points to the ſpiritual cleanſing, <hi>by the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> Ezek. 36.25. <hi>and by his blood.</hi> Heb. 9.13, 14.</p>
               <p>And breaking, ſignifies the utter aboliſhing of all ſin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs by death. We are not fully cleanſed till the Veſſel be broken, but then there is no more defilement in the Veſſel.</p>
               <p>And God will make it up again in the Reſurrection, as pure and holy as if it had never been defiled with ſin at all.</p>
               <p>Thus we have gone through the ſpecial Laws of the Sin-Offering, in theſe five Heads: for they do either concern the end, or the matter, or the blood of it, or the burning, or laſtly the eating of it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude all that hath been ſaid upon the Sin-Offering, with ſome general Inſtructions from the whole.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may here learn and be inſtructed, that even ſins of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity they do contract a guilt upon the Soul, yea, ſuch a guilt as needs Atonement and Expiation in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There are no venial ſins, the leaſt ſin is death. You muſt bring your Sin Offering, if you expect to be forgiven. Do not ſlight ſins of Infirmity, for then they become more than meer Infirmities.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is relief unto Faith againſt thoſe uſual complaints of dayly Infirmities, which many gracious Souls do ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of, and mourn under.</p>
               <p>Alas I can do nothing well; if I pray, my thoughts wander; when I hear the Word, I underſtand little, and remember leſs; I am eaſily overtaken and carried aſide dayly, I ſin in all I do.</p>
               <p>But you ſee here is a Sin Offering provided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is not a juſt man upon earth that doth good, and ſinneth not.</hi> Eccleſ. 7.20. <hi>In many things we offend all.</hi> James. 3.2. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord ordained this Sin-Offering, which, as it ſerved for a legal Expiation and purging of their ſins under that Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo it did prefigure to them the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which cleanſeth us from all our ſins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here is great encouragement to engage in the ſervice and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:96313:168"/>
work of God, notwithſtanding our own Infirmities and diſabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yet do not withdraw when called, though conſcious to thy ſelf of much unworthineſs and unfitneſs: for the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a Sin-Offering for us; he will accept our ſincere, though weak endeavours, and pardon our failings.</p>
               <p n="4">4. See and take notice what continual Obligations of love, are upon us to Jeſus Chriſt, we have ſuch continual need of him.</p>
               <p>Behold and wonder at his love, in that he was content to be made a Sin Offering for us, and ſo procures our pardon for ſuch continual ſins and failings. <hi>He that knew no ſin, was made ſin for us,</hi> that is, he was made a Sin Offering for us 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. Hence we have pardon; and not only pardon, but power alſo againſt ſin. Rom. 8.3. <hi>and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[And for ſin] that is, God ſent Chriſt for a Sin Offering: as you have the ſame word ſo rendred, <hi>Heb</hi> 10.6. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>in Sacrifices for ſin, thou hadſt no pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But my ſins are worſe then meer Infirmities of Saints, they are ſins of a groſſer nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is relief for ſuch in the Treſpaſs Offering, if they do not ſin preſumptuouſly and obſtinately. <hi>For God will wound the hairy Scalp of him that goeth on in his Treſpaſſes.</hi> Pſal. 68.21. But if you repent of it, and bring your Treſpaſs-Offering to the Lord, there is hope in <hi>Iſrael</hi> even concerning ſuch kinds of ſin alſo: of which, the Lord aſſiſting, we ſhall ſpeak the next time.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THis is the fifth ſort of legal Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>The difference between this and the Sin-Offering, as to the ſpecial end of them being in this, That the Sin-Offering ſeems to carry ſome limitation to ſins of weakneſs and ignorance: but this extends further, even to ſins againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>
               <p>This points at Chriſt as the Sin Offering, and all the reſt did: therefore Chriſt is called <hi>Aſham, Iſai.</hi> 53.</p>
               <p>The method which the Holy Ghoſt is pleaſed to uſe upon the Treſpaſs Offering, is this. He propoſeth 1. the Caſe, and 2. the Remedy: and in this method he goes over a four-fold Caſe, and a Cure and Remedy for them.</p>
               <p>The ſacred Rites and Ceremonies here required, differ little from other Offerings before handled, and therefore we may be the briefer.</p>
               <p>The firſt Caſe is three-fold, I mean there be three Caſes put together.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:96313:169"/>1. Concealment of mans knowledg, when called to teſtify up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath. Verſ. 1. <hi>If a Soul ſin, and hear the voice of Swearing, and is a Witneſs, whether he hath ſeen or known of it, if he do not utter it, then,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>[A Soul] that is, a perſon, the Soul the more noble part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſynecdochically put for the whole man.</p>
               <p>The temptation ſeems to ly here; if the perſons for Rank and Quality in the world be great, ſo that a Witneſs is afraid to ſpeak and utter his knowledg.</p>
               <p>[Hear a voice of Swearing] that is, either of the Judge adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or calling him forth to ſpeak upon Oath.</p>
               <p>Or of ſinners Swearing, Curſing, Blaſpheming.</p>
               <p>You have an Inſtance of the former in the High Prieſt. Mat. 26.63. <hi>I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be Chriſt the Son of the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto which Adjuration or voice of Swearing, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt made anſwer, and did declare the truth, though before he held his peace. For it was <hi>Caſus Confeſſionis,</hi> a caſe wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Truth was called for.</p>
               <p>Of the latter we have an Inſtance in Lev. 24.10, 11. <hi>They that heard the man blaſpheme, made complaint to Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A man may contract upon himſelf the guilt of other mens ſins, by concealing them, if he be called to reveal them.</p>
               <p>This preſuppoſeth a Magiſtrate that is not given to ſwearing, and curſing and damning himſelf: for if God give up his people unto the hands of ſuch Magiſtrates, in ſuch a caſe they have none to complain to.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Inſtance, is ceremonial uncleanneſs, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, and 3. whereof you read in the 11. Chapter of this Book, and ſo forward to the 16. wherein the ſeveral ſorts of legal or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial uncleanneſs are treated of at large.</p>
               <p>But do theſe things defile the Conſcience, and contract a guilt upon the Soul?</p>
               <p>They do not under the Goſpel; but yet they did under the Law, becauſe then God had forbidden it.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe it were unknown and involuntary; is the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence defiled by Caſualties?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:96313:169"/>No, but yet they muſt ſeek atonement, and bring their Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs-Offering. Doubtleſs this was to teach them and us to ſeek pardon for unknown and ſecret ſins; I mean unknown to our ſelves, as well as to others Pſal. 19.12. <hi>Who can underſtand his errors? Cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[When he knoweth] As ſoon as God convinceth the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any ſin, any defilement that we have contracted, there is no delaying, but we muſt make haſt to make our peace with him: but as ſoon as the ſin is known, by the knowledg of the Rule that enjoyns duty and forbids diſobedience, men muſt look out for pardon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Caſe is, ſwearing to do an unlawful thing, as <hi>David did.</hi> 1 Sam. 25.22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herods Oath,</hi> Mark. 6.23. was ſuch an one: and ſo was theirs that ſware to kill <hi>Paul.</hi> Act. 23.21.</p>
               <p>Of this ſort was <hi>Jepthahs</hi> Vow, <hi>Judg.</hi> 11.30, 31. it was a raſh Vow. What if a Dog or a Swine had met him firſt? Or ſome other Beaſt that was unclean for Sacrifice?</p>
               <p>Here was ground for a Treſpaſs-Offering.</p>
               <p>Now the Remedy provided is in general, confeſſing his ſin with a Treſpaſs-Offering. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
               <p>It is in particular threefold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A Lamb or a Kid, a Female.</hi> verſ. 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If he be not able to compaſs this. <hi>Two Turtle Doves, or two young Pigeons,</hi> the one for a Sin-Offering, the other for a Burnt-Offering: whoſe Rites and Ordinances are ſet down, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>The Lord graciouſly condeſcends and provides for the pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and neceſſities of his people.</p>
               <p>[Verſ. 10. <hi>According to the manner</hi>] According to the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>The Sin-Offering was for that peculiar ſin that burdened his Conſcience. The Burnt Offering, for all his ſins in general.</p>
               <p>The particular ſin was to be firſt expiated, as that the guilt whereof was moſt preſſing upon the Conſcience, and which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God moſt.</p>

               <p>The holy things of the Lord is things dedicated to him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there were many, and of many ſorts under the Law.</p>
               <p>As for Inſtance, They were <hi>not to eat within their private Gates the Tyth of their Corn, Wine, Oyl,</hi> &amp;c. Deut. 12.17, 18. They were <hi>to ſanctify all the Firſtling Males.</hi> Deut. 15.19.</p>
               <p>To this ſort may be referred the ſin of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> they did rob God of his holy things, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.1, 2. though they did it knowingly, and ſo it was worſe than this caſe, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ignorance.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>[The Prieſt ſhall make atonement]</hi> For though the Treſpaſſer do reſtore; yet atonement could not be made, but by the Prieſt and the Sacrifice appointed, which leads us to Chriſt and to his death, to ſeek atonement with God there. There is no expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin in our amendment or reformation, but in the blood of Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>[If a Soul ſin and commit a Treſpaſs againſt the Lord, and lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his neighbour]</hi> For ſins againſt our neighbour, are alſo ſins againſt God.</p>
               <p>Pſal. 51.4. <hi>Againſt thee only;</hi> that is, thee chiefly. For he had ſinned againſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> and againſt <hi>Bathſhebah,</hi> and had done them both irreparable wrong. But that which lay heavieſt upon him, was the injury done to God: <hi>I have ſinned</hi> Luk. 15.18. <hi>againſt Heaven,</hi> that is, againſt the God of Heaven.</p>
               <p>The Remedy appointed is threefold; the two former are not for ſatisfaction to God, but to the party injured, without which there can be no effectual application of the atonement to thy Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Reſtitution.</hi> Verſ. 4. This is the ground of that ſaying, <hi>non remittitur furtum, niſi reſtituatur ablatum:</hi> the theft is not forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, without reſtitution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Addition of a fifth part.</hi> verſ. 5. This is when the ſinner out of the conviction of his own Conſcience, doth it of his own accord. For if he were convicted by the Magiſtracy and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Juſtice of the Land, he muſt reſtore fourfold in ſome caſes, and double in other caſes: ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.1, to 4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A Ram for a Treſpaſs Offering.</hi> verſ. 6.</p>
               <p>Some general Inſtructions from the whole.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may here learn and ſee in the Treſpaſs Offering, and the Laws and Ordinances thereof, how much there is of the will of God in the matters of his worſhip: for there are divers things in this, as well as in the other Offerings and Sacrifices, whereof there can no account be given, but the divine will and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>As that the Treſpaſs Offering, which mentions greater ſins, ſuch as ſtealing, lying, perjury, ſhould have a leſſer Sacrifice to
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:96313:171"/>
expiate the guilt thereof, than was appointed in the Sin-Offering for a Ram is the higheſt Sacrifice here required.</p>
               <p>But the Sin-Offering, which is for ignorances and infirmities, requires no leſs than a young Bullock for ſome kind of perſons. And why a young Bullock for the Prieſt, and no more but a Goat, a Male for the Civil Ruler?</p>
               <p>Reaſon would ſay, this ſhould be as great, if not greater then the Prieſts; Magiſtracy being as great, and as high a power as Miniſtry. Who is able to give any neceſſary reaſon for theſe things? One Reaſon indeed might be to lead them from the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to the ſubſtance, that they might not dwell and reſt in the outward Type and Ceremony, but look further to what was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by them.</p>
               <p>For if the atonement had lain in the Type, there muſt have been other proportions ſet down between ſin and ſin: but the will of the Lawgiver is enough, and this we muſt acquieſce in, where no other reaſon doth appear.</p>
               <p>You have formerly heard, how the Lord ſaith upon the Meat-Offering, I will have no Leaven nor Honey; but in the Peace-Offering he ſaith, I will have Leaven. In all the Fire-Offerings he ſaith, I will not have Honey; but in the Firſt Fruits he will have Honey.</p>
               <p>His Will is our Rule, his Will as revealed in his Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. See the ſovereign virtue of the blood of Chriſt: for he is our Treſpaſs-Offering, as well as our Sin Offering.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.10. its ſaid, <hi>When thou ſhalt make his Soul an Offering for ſin.</hi> The word is the ſame with this, <hi>Aſham naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſho</hi> his Soul a Treſpaſs-Offering.</p>
               <p>Here are ſins againſt knowledg mentioned: thieving, lying, perjury; ſins which do amount to a very ſtupendious guilt.</p>
               <p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Hence thirdly here is encouragement to the greateſt ſinners, to have recourſe to him and to his blood, and to make uſe of him for atonement. There is atonement in the blood of Chriſt our Treſpaſs-Offering, even for Thieves, Oppreſſors, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, and perjured perſons.</p>
               <p>Let me ſpeak particularly to theſe ſins mentioned in the Text, and that in this method.</p>

                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:96313:171"/>
                  <item>1. To ſhew the greatneſs of theſe ſins. And then,</item>
                  <item>2. That yet there is atonement for them in the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Theft and unjuſt dealing. That this is a very grievous ſin appears by this, becauſe it is ſo contrary to the very light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to that golden Rule of equity, to do as you would be done to, and is deſtructive to humane Society.</p>
               <p>That it is againſt light appears, becauſe they labour to hide it, and are aſhamed of it, if it come to be known. Jer. 2.26. <hi>As a Thief is aſhamed when he is found.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this further ſhews the greatneſs of it, That God inſiſts upon reſtitution and ſatisfaction to the party injured. Conſider this all you that are Tradeſmen, and have much dealing in the world, and you that are Apprentices and Servants. If you ſteal and pilfer from your Maſters, though it be but a Groat or Six-pence, if you do not reſtore it, God will never pardon you.</p>
               <p>But what if a man be not able, and have not wherewith to reſtore? That is a ſad caſe; but in ſuch a caſe God may accept the will for the deed.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe the perſons may be dead and gone?</p>
               <p>The anſwer that Caſuiſts give in ſuch a caſe is, that then you muſt reſtore it to God, by giving it to the poor, or to ſome good uſe; reſtore you muſt, one way or other.</p>
               <p>For without reſtitution there is no remiſſion; and the Reaſon is clear. Becauſe the detaining of unjuſt gotten Goods, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the ſin: the taking poſſeſſion of them was theft, the keeping that unjuſt poſſeſſion, is a continuation of that theft. Zach. 5.4. <hi>The curſe of God ſhall enter into the houſe of the Thief, and remain in it, and conſume it, with the timber and ſtones of it.</hi> The curſe of God will be upon thee in all thy comforts, in all thy concernments.</p>
               <p>But yet there is atonement. We have two Inſtances in the Scripture, of Thieves that were converted and ſaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zacheus, Luk.</hi> 19.8, 9, 10. but he made reſtitution, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. And the Thief on the Croſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Violence; here is a ſin againſt the ſixth Commandment ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:96313:172"/>
to a ſin againſt the eighth: for Violence belongs to the ſixth Commandment. <hi>Thou ſhalt not murther:</hi> they are beginnings of blood, they have a tendency to it, and blood is a ſin that crys.</p>
               <p>There are many threatnings againſt this ſin. Pſal. 104.11. <hi>Evil ſhall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is againſt light, for no man would be ſo uſed himſelf.</p>
               <p>Yet there is atonement for this; you have Inſtance in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the worſt ſort, proceeding even unto blood, and that in a way of perſecution for Righteouſneſs ſake, in <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> who had been men of much violence, and yet were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and ſaved. <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21. with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12, 13. And <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 14.</p>
               <p>It is like the Thief on the Croſs was ſuch a one: an High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way man, a violent thief, or elſe by their Law they could not have put him to death; but yet the Lord ſhewed mercy to his Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Lying; a grievous ſin, and againſt a double light and knowledg; both knowledg of the Rule, and of the Fact, which riſeth up in the mind againſt a Lyar when he ſpeaks a lye.</p>
               <p>It is uſually one of the firſt actual ſins that breaks forth in Children. Pſal. 58.3. <hi>The wicked are eſtranged from the womb, they go aſtray as ſoon as they be born, ſpeaking lyes.</hi> And there be dreadful threatnings againſt it, ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. you that are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents may do well to teach your Children that Scripture.</p>
               <p>Yet there is atonement for this ſin alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> ſometimes told lyes to ſave his life: but yet he was deeply humbled for it, <hi>his Soul cleaved to the duſt about it, and melted for heavineſs.</hi> Pſal. 119.25, 28, 29.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Perjury and falſe ſwearing; a moſt horrible ſin, for a man to invoke the God of Truth to joyn with him in a lye, and to co-atteſt and bear witneſs with him to a lye: and this ſin ſeldom eſcapes unpuniſhed, even in this life.</p>
               <p>God uſually ſets ſome viſible mark and token of his vengeance and wrath upon them, even in this life. <hi>Jer.</hi> 34.15— 18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.15— 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Yet we have an Inſtance, and but one that I remember in all
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:96313:172"/>
the Bible, of a man that found mercy for this ſin, and that is <hi>Peter,</hi> who denyed Chriſt with ſwearing and curſing: but he went out and wept bitterly, and when his broken bones were ſet again, as in nature they grow ſtronger there than in another place: ſo <hi>Peter</hi> grew very bold in preaching and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſt, whom before he had ſo fearfully denyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. But there be divers ſins which are not here ſpecified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yet they are included, and underſtood by a parity of reaſon: and there might be ſome reaſons given, why it might not be convenient to mention ſome ſins particularly, which yet were included, and for which there was atonement.</p>
               <p>As if a man be overtaken in drink, or luſt, or paſſion, raſh anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe and all other pardonable ſins, are included ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Treſpaſs Offering by a parity of reaſon, with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances mentioned in the Text, or elſe under the Sin-Offering, or the Burnt-Offering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. But ſome ſins were not intended to be included in any of the Sacrifices of the Law: but they had no atonement, no Sacrifice provided for them, as Murther and Whoredom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This was for a ſpecial reaſon, becauſe there was a civil penalty appointed in ſuch Caſes, and for ſuch ſins extending even unto death. And it had been incongruous to that legal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal diſpenſation they were under, to appoint a Sacrifice to make atonement for Capital ſins, for which the ſinner was to be cut off.</p>
               <p>This made <hi>David</hi> cry, <hi>Sacrifice thou wouldſt not,</hi> Pſal. 51. <hi>elſe would I give it,</hi> he was at a loſs what to do. There was no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion made by the Law for atonement in that caſe of his: but as God by prerogative and ſpecial diſpenſation ſpared his life, ſo he did alſo forgive his ſin, and taught him upon this occaſion the imperfection of all the legal Sacrifices: but yet there is an atonement and a Treſpaſs Offering provided under the Goſpel, even for ſuch ſins. There is a ſpiritual Sacrifice, Jeſus Chriſt and his blood: therefore ſuch notorious ſinners ſhould not deſpair: ſee 1 Cor. 6.11. <hi>Such were ſome of you,</hi> foul enough and bad enough, <hi>but ye are waſhed, but ye are juſtified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:96313:173"/>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. But there be ſome ſins even under the Goſpel, for which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>there remaineth no more Sacrifice for ſin,</hi> Heb. 10. <hi>but fiery indignation and fearful looking for of Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is only the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many when in trouble of Conſcience, are apt to fear they have committed this ſin; I ſhall therefore open a little to you the nature of it, to prevent miſtakes and diſcouragements: I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you both wherein it doth not, and wherein it doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>And firſt wherein it doth not conſiſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not every error in fundamentals that amounts to this ſin: for ſome Hereticks have been renewed by repentance, have been converted and reclaimed from the error of their way, which they that ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt cannot be.</p>
               <p>Yea 2. ſuppoſe a man do not only err in fundamental truths, but ſpeak reproachful piercing words againſt it, as the Quakers uſe to do when they ſcoff againſt a Chriſt without us, and againſt the Bible, calling it a dead letter.</p>
               <p>This is blaſphemy; but yet it is not impoſſible even for ſuch a one, to repent and be forgiven: for Mat. 12.30, 32. <hi>every Blaſphemy againſt the Son,</hi> that is, every kind or ſort of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <hi>may be forgiven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet further, that ſin which of all other doth in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects come neareſt to the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. For here is malice; yet ſome, even of theſe alſo, have obtained mercy; as <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, who before his Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was a Perſecutor, he was both a fundamental Heretick, and a Blaſphemer, and a Perſecutor.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some have thought it doth conſiſt in univerſal Apoſtacy; but theſe are rather Circumſtances that may accompany it, but are not of the eſſence of it.</p>
               <p>Apoſtaſie is not eſſential to it, much leſs univerſal Apoſtaſie. It is true, thoſe in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. were Apoſtates that fell away from their former profeſſion: therefore Apoſtaſie is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found in this ſin, but not always. For the Phariſees had never profeſſed Chriſt; yet they did ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.32, 33.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:96313:173"/>Moreover Apoſtates in ſome caſes may be recovered. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. and 3.18.</p>
               <p>And as to that of univerſal apoſtacy, the Phariſees did not caſt off all profeſſion of God and of the truth, they were not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Apoſtates. Therefore a man may pretend to Religion and be a Profeſſor of it in ſome degree, and yet a Phariſee, <hi>doing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite unto the Spirit of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee negatively, concerning this impardonable ſin, what it is not. There may be fundamental error, yea Blaſphemy, Perſecution, yet not unpardonable: moreover a man may ſin this ſin, and yet not be an univerſal Apoſtate, as the Phariſees. But if all this be not the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, what is it, and wherein doth it conſiſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There be two Ingredients that do concur to this ſin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Inward conviction by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Malice; This is that the Apoſtle intends by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>if we ſin wilfully.</hi> Heb. 10. Hence our Saviour calls it <hi>Blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spirit.</hi> Mat. 12. That is, againſt the inward illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conviction of the Spirit in a mans Conſcience.</p>
               <p>If there be not a conjunction of both theſe, both inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and malicious oppoſition, if there be only one of theſe, without the other, it is not the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> in his denying Chriſt, and ſwearing falſly about it, he ſinned againſt Light and inward Conviction; but this was not the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe he did it not in malice, but only out of fear to ſave his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> before his Converſion, did ſin and perſecute out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; but yet he did not commit this ſin, becauſe he wanted Light and inward Conviction: himſelf gives us this account of it, 1 Tim. 1.13. <hi>but I obtained mercy becauſe I did it ignorantly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But can this be known concerning others?</p>
               <p>Yes it may be known; therefore 1 Joh. 5.16. <hi>pray not for ſuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will further clear up the nature of the ſin, to name ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſuch as have committed it.</p>
               <p>There be ſome Inſtances and Examples of it in the Scripture: and there have been ſome ſince the Scriptures were written.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:96313:174"/>The Scripture mentions the Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> inſtanceth in the Convicted, and yet apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate <hi>Jews</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since the Scriptures were written.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate is thought to have ſinned this ſin: for he had Light enough, he was a Chriſtian, and an high Profeſſor of Chriſtianity, before his Apoſtaſie.</p>
               <p>He did profeſs Religion to ſuch a degree, that he was wont to read in the Church in the publick Aſſemblies; he did not diſdain to read the Bible to them in the Church Aſſemblies, though he was of the blood Royal: but after he was ſetled in the Empire, he fell away to Paganiſm; and not only ſo, but to moſt malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and crafty Perſecution.</p>
               <p>Some have obſerved of him, that he did not put forth ſuch Edicts for the putting Chriſtians to death, as ſome former Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors had been wont to do. He did forbear to do it out of craft and malice, becauſe he had obſerved the truth of that Speech, <hi>ſanguis Martyrum ſemen Eccleſiae,</hi> the blood of Martyrs is the Seed of the Church: he ſaw that ſuch a courſe would propagate Chriſtianity the more, and increaſe the Church rather than di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh it.</p>
               <p>Therefore he choſe rather to lay ſnares for their Conſciences, by way of ſubtilty to draw them from the Truth, and ſo to waſh his hands in the blood of their Souls (a ſweeter victory to him) then of their bodies; and to triumph over them in their falls, rather then in their deaths, denying them the uſe of Books or Schools to get Learning, ſuffering none to bear Office in War or Peace: and when he dyed, being ſhot with an Arrow in a Battle, and feeling himſelf mortally wounded, he pluckt out the Arrow and threw it up with his own Bowels, with theſe words, <hi>viciſti, Galilaee viciſti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe latter times, of all the Perſecutors in Queen <hi>Marys</hi> time, there is none that ſeems to have ſinned and ſhed the blood of Saints againſt Light, more than <hi>Stephen Gardner;</hi> of whom there is this Story in the Book of Martyrs and others, that write of thoſe times: That having invited ſundry perſons of Quality,

the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and others to dine with him at his houſe. he would not ſit down to Dinner, till he had news brought him by his ſervant, of the death of two Martyrs <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Latimer,</hi> who ſuffered at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and ſo made his Friends and Gueſts ſtay, and wait upon his cruelty and blood thirſtineſs till four a clock in the Afternoon: and then being informed, that fire was moſt certainly ſet to them, he ſaid, now let us go to Dinner; and he began to eat, but was taken ill and carried ſick from his Table, and ſo lay fifteen days in moſt intollerable torments, having no eaſe or voidance of any thing in his body by Urine or otherwiſe, his body being miſerably inflamed thereby, and thruſting his tongue out of his mouth ſwollen and black: and while he lay in this condition, uttering ſometimes words of deſpair and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, when Dr. <hi>Day</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> came to him, and began to comfort him with the Promiſes of the Goſpel, and free Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification in the blood of Chriſt; what, my Lord (ſaith he) will you open that Gap now? Nay then farewell all together: ſuch words may be fit for one in my condition; but if once you open that Gap to the people, then farewel altogether. And when he was put in remembrance of <hi>Peters</hi> denying his Maſter, he ſaid, that he had denyed with <hi>Peter,</hi> but had never repented with <hi>Peter.</hi>

               <p>Open that Gap to the people, and then farewel all together: juſt as the Phariſees ſaid, they feared the people would go after Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Some have Inſtanced alſo in ſome of the laſt killers of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Chriſt: <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. of whom it is ſaid, <hi>fire proceedeth out of their mouths and devours their Adverſaries.</hi> verſ. 5. which they parallel with that expreſſion of the Apoſtle, Heb. 10.27. <hi>a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fearful looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation that ſhall devour the Adverſaries.</hi>

and doctrine of the Witneſſes. It is ſpoken in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. in alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Moſes,</hi> by whom thoſe Rebels (<hi>Corah</hi> and his Company, as alſo <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi>) were burnt with fire.</p>
               <p>There be two things which are ſure ſignes a man hath not committed it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the Soul is afraid of it, leaſt they have committed this ſin; here is no malice againſt the Spirit of Grace: for on the contrary, here is a fear leaſt they have ſinned againſt him this great ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If there be but common meltings and relentings of heart, yea though without any true and ſaving brokenneſs and ſoftneſs of heart; yet even this common work is evidence enough, that this ſin hath not been committed: for the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is the higheſt degree of wickedneſs and hardneſs of heart: but where there are any common meltings, there is not the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of hardneſs; therefore there is not the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. In ſuch there is a perfect fixation of the will in evil, like the very Devils and the damned in Hell.</p>
               <p>Therefore let the greateſt ſinners know, if God hath but kept them from this unpardonable ſin, that there is hope and help in the Goſpel for them: there is atonement in the blood of Chriſt for all that come unto God by him, God hath not excluded thee, do not thou exclude thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, there is atonement; but how are we to apply this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement? How may we ſo improve and apply that precious blood of Chriſt, as to get peace by it, and ſenſe of pardon and reconciliation with God?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Turn your eyes and thoughts from all other things but the blood of Jeſus Chriſt alone for reconciliation: a man may ſet his mark upon his Sheep, but it is his money that bought them.</p>
               <p>Other things may be Evidences of Juſtification; but it is the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt that purchaſes it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8. Never think to make God amends, or content his Juſtice, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe his Wrath by any thing that you can do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Get a thorough conviction in thy Conſcience, of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the atonement, and the Soul-redeeming virtue that is in
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:96313:175"/>
the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, that <hi>it cleanſeth from all ſin.</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7. The redeeming power of the blood of Chriſt, is greater then the condemning power of ſin. This excellency it hath from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and dignity of his perſon, (<hi>for it is the blood of God</hi> Act. 20.28.) which makes his obedience and ſuffering give more glory to God, then our ſufferings in Hell would have done. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Lord to make a clear diſcovery of this myſtery to thy ſoul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider how freely this blood is held forth and offered in the Goſpel, to be reſted on by ſinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. and 16.26. God has revealed it, that it may be reſted on.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be not afraid of receiving the Atonement, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11.17. but rather be afraid to reject it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. We ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of believing, but of not believing: for the Goſpel is not tendred unto men, that they ſhould have notions in their heads, but that they ſhould believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.23, 24.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let your acting of Faith upon Jeſus Chriſt, be always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with repentance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. laſt. This obviates that Objection about fear of preſuming: if thy Faith be accompanied with repentance, thou doſt not preſume.</p>

               <p>INtending at this time (my brethren) to wind up this Subject of the Legal Offerings and Sacrifices; I have therefore now reſumed this Text, from which you may remember two Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins have been formerly obſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there was a divine Inſtitution and command of God, for the Offerings and Sacrifices that were under the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there were ſix kinds or ſorts of propitiatory Sacrifices under the Law, namely, the Burnt-Offering, the Meat Offering, the Peace-Offering, the Sin-Offering, the Treſpaſs-Offering, and the Offering of Conſecrations, in <hi>Serm.</hi> 1. of <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. on this Text <hi>pag.</hi> 232, 233.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. That the propitiatory Sacrifices under the Law, may be referred to theſe ſix kinds or ſorts, <hi>viz. &amp;c</hi>—</p>
               <p>In the proſecution of this Doctrine, we have gone through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Offerings and Sacrifices of the old Law, in the way of Expoſition upon the former Chapters of this Book, to <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. of <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>The five firſt ſort of Sacrifices have been ſpoken to at large.</p>
               <p>As to the ſixth, <hi>the Offering of Conſecrations,</hi> there will be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak ſomething of it, when we come to the Prieſthood: neither is it handled at large in theſe firſt Chapters of <hi>Leviticus,</hi>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:96313:176"/>
but only ſome of the Laws of it briefly toucht upon; therefore I ſhall refer what I ſhall ſpeak of it, to that other place.</p>
               <p>As to what remains of the 6. and 7. Chapters of this Book, they containing ſome additional Laws to the Offerings before treated of, they were ſpoken to under the Offerings to which they belong.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore now proceed unto two or three Queſtions that remain to be conſidered, before we leave this point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. The firſt is, whether the legal Sacrifices may not be otherwiſe diſtributed, and what other diſtributions there be of them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The anſwer is, That the Scripture gives other diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alſo, as well as this in the Text; but I choſe to handle them in this, as the plaineſt for weak memories.</p>
               <p>They are ſometimes thus divided into <hi>Zebach</hi> and <hi>Mincha;</hi> that is, ſlaughtered Offerings and Meat-Offerings. Dan. 9.27. <hi>He ſhall cauſe the Sacrifice and Oblation to ceaſe.</hi> The word is, the Slaughter Offering and the Meat Offering to ceaſe; <hi>Zebach</hi> and <hi>Mincha,</hi> and in many other Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The Meat Offerings, were of Inanimate things offered up to God by fire upon the Altar.</p>
               <p>But the Slaughtered Offerings were of living Creatures, and theſe were offered up both by fire and blood, the Beaſt being firſt ſlain, and then burnt with fire.</p>
               <p>Some have diſtinguiſhed theſe two, in reſpect of their ends and uſes, thus; That the ſlain Sacrifices reſpected chiefly the ſufferings, and paſſive obedience of Chriſt, as making ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for our ſins, by his death and blood: and that the Meat-Offering related chiefly to his active obedience, whereby he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Law for us, by his holy and bleſſed life, good works being as it were meat and drink to an holy heart.</p>
               <p>In the Meat-Offering therefore (ſay they) was ſhadowed by the burning and aſcending of Inanimate things, the obedience and merits of Chriſt to come: but it is not to be reſtrained to his active obedience only; for the burning and deſtroying the Meat-Offering by fire, did plainly repreſent the ſufferings of Chriſt for
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:96313:177"/>
the ſatisfaction of divine Juſtice, as was formerly ſhewed more fully in the Expoſition of the Meat Offering.</p>
               <p>Moreover the ſlaughtered Offerings may be ſubdivided from their ends and uſes, thus: That they were either ſimply for atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and pardon of ſin, or for other occaſions alſo.</p>
               <p>Thoſe for atonement of ſin, were either for all ſins in general, or with ſpecial reſpect to ſome particulars.</p>
               <p>For all ſins in general, was the Burnt-Offering, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was offered every day. There was <hi>holocauſtum juge,</hi> for thoſe <hi>peccata jugia,</hi> a dayly Burnt-Offering for thoſe continual dayly ſins, and ſinfulneſs of our hearts and natures. Numb. 28.10. <hi>This is the Burnt-Offering of every Sabbath, beſides the continual Burnt-Offering, and its Drink Offering: which was offered every day at morning and at evening,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Geneva</hi> Note: of which <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> that <hi>by him the dayly Sacrifice was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en away.</hi> Dan. 8.11.</p>
               <p>As to particular ſins, they being of two ſorts either leſſer or greater; there were two ſorts of Sacrifices provided for them. For ſins committed through ignorance and infirmity, the Sin-Offering: but the Treſpaſs-Offering, extended even to ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt light and knowledg. Theſe were the Sacrifices meerly for atonement and expiation of ſin.</p>
               <p>As to other occaſions alſo, there were two Sacrifices appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ordained of old.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to aſſurance of peace, and of the love of God; the Peace-Offering, which was a Sacrifice both of atonement and of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to acceptance and entrance into Office in the Church, the <hi>Milluim,</hi> or the Offering of Conſecration, wherein, beſides atonement of ſin, this was ſuperadded, the Inveſtiture of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into truſt and office in the houſe of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. A ſecond Enquiry may be this; whether there were not other Sacrifices, beſides what are comprehended under theſe diſtributions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There were ſome others, but they were peculiar Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; theſe were the ordinary ſort of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:96313:177"/>As for the reſt, either they may be ſome way reduced and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to ſome of theſe, or elſe they will come in and may be fitly handled in other places. As for Inſtance; <hi>the two Sparrows in the cleanſing of the Leper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> were a peculiar kind of Sacrifice, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. And they will come in among the Laws and Ceremonies of Purification, when we ſpirit of ceremonial cleanneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs: ſo will alſo <hi>the Sacrifice of the red Heifer and the holy Water, or water of Purification made of the Aſhes, of that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> Numb. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Paſchal Lamb</hi> alſo was a peculiar Sacrifice, but it will fitly come in to be handled in the Feaſt of the Paſſover, when we come to the Feſtivals: and there alſo <hi>the Sacrifices of the yearly Feaſt of Expiation, on the tenth day of the ſeventh month</hi> will come to be conſidered: one part whereof is <hi>the Scape Goat.</hi> Levit. 16. But the ordinary Sacrifices, were theſe that have been handled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. The third <hi>Quaere</hi> may be this; Theſe ſix here enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the Text, being the ordinary ſorts of propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; what other Sacrifices had they, beſides theſe of propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or atonement?</p>
               <p>I anſwer as to that; when I entred firſt upon the Subject, you may remember I diſtributed the Offerings at the Brazen Altar into two ſorts: Holineſs of Holineſs, and Holineſs of Praiſes; or Sacrifices of Atonement, and of Thankſgiving.</p>
               <p>You find this diſtinction of double Holineſs and ſingle Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in Lev. 21.22. <hi>he ſhall eat the Bread of his God,</hi> that is, of the Sacrifices, both of <hi>the moſt Holy,</hi> and of <hi>the Holy:</hi> ſo the Fruit of the Land after it was Circumciſed, is ſaid to be Holineſs of Praiſes to the Lord, Lev. 19.24. <hi>Quodeſh Hillulim,</hi> is contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed unto <hi>Quodeſh quodeſhim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former ſort of Sacrifices, namely thoſe that were Holy of Holineſſes for atonement, were made by fire: but the latter ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as were meerly Sacrifices of Thankſgiving, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Praiſes, were not offered up to God in the fire, but by other Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>Of theſe there were two ſorts, the Heave-Offering, and the Wave Offering; of both which we ſhall ſpeak a word briefly,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:96313:178"/>
both concerning the matter, the manner, and the ſignification of them.</p>
               <p>The firſt mention we have of them, is in <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.24, 26, 27. in the Offering of Conſecration.</p>
               <p>The Shoulder is an Heave Offering, and the Breſt a Wave-Offering. Again in <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. the right Shoulder and the Breſt, is reſerved out of all the Peace-Offerings for a Wave Offering, and an Heave-Offering to the Lord for the Prieſts, ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 34.</p>
               <p>Again in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.10, 11. we read of a Wave-Sheaf of the Firſt Fruit of your Harveſt unto the Prieſt. <hi>And ye ſhall wave the Sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you.</hi> This was to be done the morrow after the Sabbath of the Paſſover, and fifty days after, at the Feaſt of Pentecoſt, they were to offer two Wave-Loaves, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17, 20.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the matter of theſe Offerings.</p>
               <p>The Rite and Ceremony with which they were offered, was <hi>Waveing</hi> and <hi>Heaveing,</hi> from whence they have their names of Wave-Offering and Heave-Offering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Waveing,</hi> that is, moving it to and fro round about towards the Eaſt, Weſt, South, and North. <hi>Tenuphah agitatio,</hi> from the Verb <hi>Nuph,</hi> which in <hi>Hiphil</hi> is <hi>agitavit, ventilavit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heaveing,</hi> that is, lifting it up towards Heaven. <hi>Terumah,</hi> from <hi>Rum elevari, extolli.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were Geſtures (ſome may think) ſomewhat ſtrange, and hardly grave enough in the Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>But what was the myſtery and meaning of them?</p>
               <p>You will find that clearly expreſſed, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.11. <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>ſhall offer the Levites before the Lord, for an Offering of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that they may execute the ſervice of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Hebrew reads it (as your Margin tells you) thus, and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſhall wave the Levites befor the Lord for a Wave-Offering of the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then was the end and the meaning of theſe Geſtures, to preſent and dedicate the thing to the Lord, who, if he will have it done by ſuch or ſuch a Geſture, who, or what is vain man, that he ſhould controle or find fault with the unſearchable Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:96313:178"/>
and ſovereign Authority of the Lord God Almighty.</p>
               <p>Theſe words are uſed generally concerning all things given or dedicated to God; as Exod. 35.22. <hi>And every one that offered, offered an Offering of Gold unto the Lord Heniph Tenuphath, agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavit agitationem:</hi> he waved a Wave-Offering of Gold unto the Lord: even Land it ſelf, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48.8, 9, 10, 20.</p>
               <p>Perſons alſo are ſaid to be waved as a Wave-Offering, when dedicated to the Lord. <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.11.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Wave,</hi> the Greek tranſlateth ſeparate; which word <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth, ſpeaking of his Deſignation to the Miniſtry. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.1.</p>
               <p>Some have obſerved ſomething more in theſe Geſtures, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that of waveing to and fro round about.</p>
               <p>The original word is ſometimes uſed for ſifting in a Sieve, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.28. That ſignifies Tryals and Afflictions, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.31. And ſo the Prophets apply this word unto Troubles, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 10.32. and 13.2. and 30.28.</p>
               <p>The ſenſe then will amount to thus much, That the Saints and Miniſters are ſpiritual Prieſts, are conſecrated to the Lord through ſufferings. As it is ſaid of Chriſt the Captain of our Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. ſo the Saints 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4, 10. As the Wave-Offering was toſt and waved to and fro, and thereby dedicated to the Lord.</p>
               <p>There is ſome Controverſy upon theſe,<note place="margin">Mede Diſc. <hi>49.</hi> pag. <hi>384.</hi>
                  </note> ſtarted by a learned man, and one of much Light in other things, however he miſt it in this, there being <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid humanum</hi> in the beſt of men: and <hi>humanum eſt errare,</hi> no man but is ſubject to error and miſtakes.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion is, whether they were Ceremonial and ceaſed, or Moral and Perpetual.</p>
               <p>But the caſe is clear and eaſy concerning them both; both the Heave-Offerings and the Wave-Offerings, they were Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and they are aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> They were not Types of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If they were Types or legal adumbrations of Chriſtian duties, or of any of the Benefits of Chriſt, this ſufficeth, and is enough to make them Ceremonial, and conſequently aboliſhed. For the Types (as hath been often ſaid and proved, and muſt be
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:96313:179"/>
now again repeated) do not relate only to the perſon of Chriſt, but to all Goſpel Truths and Myſteries.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> So might the Peace-Offerings in this Chapter, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.15, 16. The Offerer had a ſhare in them, and yet they were Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, and not Moral.</p>
               <p>Moreover, not only the Temple and the Prieſts there, but the whole Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> and the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were a typical Land, and a typical people: and (as hath been formerly and ſhall be further ſhewed) all the Fruits of the Land had a typical Holineſs; the Firſt Fruits being virtually the whole, they were a typical dedication of the whole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Scripture expreſly rejects other Sacrifices and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and doth not mention theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yet theſe are included by a parity of reaſon; if the chief be rejected, much more the leſſer and inferior.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But Chriſtians under the New Teſtament, are bound to give part of their ſubſtance to the Lord, and to his uſe and ſervice: therefore theſe are Moral.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, it follows not; for this is a moral duty to give part of our ſubſtance to the Lord: but yet the Heave-Offerings and Wave Offerings are ceaſed, that is, the Ceremony is ceaſed: but the ſubſtance or thing ſignified remains.</p>
               <p>The <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of theſe Offerings, did not conſiſt (as ſome have thought) in prayer and thankſgiving: for there was pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and thankſgiving in other Offerings alſo, as well as theſe, yea in all their Offerings.</p>
               <p>Are they not commanded to lay their hands upon the Sacrifice of Atonement, by way of prayer and confeſſion? <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of this and other Offerings, doth conſiſt chiefly in the Ceremonies ordained to be uſed about them, which is a great part of that which diſtinguiſheth one Offering from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as you have formerly heard: therefore if Waveing and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:96313:179"/>
Heaving be not to be uſed under the Goſpel, as ſacred and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Ceremonies in the preſenting and dedicating of our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the Lord, the Wave, and the Heave Offering are ceaſed.</p>
               <p>But the Geſtures of waving and heaving are not to be uſed, as ſacred and ſignificant Ceremonies under the Goſpel: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wave and Heave Offering are ceaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Remember thoſe great Goſpel Myſteries which are the ſcope of all Sacrifices, which (as you have heard) are chiefly theſe two, Atonement and Thankſgiving.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Atonement and Reconciliation; this was the great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry taught and held forth in all the propitiatory Sacrifices, that we are reconciled unto God, by the death and ſufferings of his Son: and that they had ſo great a multitude and variety of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, plainly taught them two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The imperfection of all thoſe legal Sacrifices; it taught them to look beyond theſe, for a more perfect Sacrifice then any of theſe, which might ſerve once for all.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle expreſly ſpells out this Leſſon to us, from the multitude and iteration of the Sacrifices. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This great variety of Sacrifices, taught them alſo the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and manifold Benefits of Chriſt, and of his death and blood. Though Chriſt be one, and dyed once for all; yet the Benefits that come by him are many: no one thing alone was ſufficient to repreſent the fulneſs that is in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond great thing held forth by their legal Offerings, is Praiſe and Thankfulneſs: This was the intent of the holy Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, as Atonement was of the moſt Holy.</p>
               <p>This was the meaning of the Heave-Offering and the Wave-Offering; a thankful frame of ſpirit, to dedicate and give up our ſelves unto the Lord, to be owning God, acknowledging and admiring God in every thing, receiving it as from his hand, and returning it to him again, by uſing it to his Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. We ſee here the riſe, and withal the ſinfulneſs of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Popiſh Superſtitions; they borrow many of them from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and from the Ceremonial Law.</p>
               <p>As when they talk of a Sacrifice, a propitiatory Sacrifice in the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:96313:180"/>
Maſs for Quick and Dead: and ſo to call the Communion-Table an Altar.</p>
               <p>It is true, we have an Altar and a Sacrifice under the Goſpel: but this Altar is the Deity of Jeſus Chriſt: this Sacrifice is the blood of Chriſt: this is the true Atonement between God and ſinners, whereof the blood of Bulls and Goats, was but a weak and low and ſhady repreſentation.</p>
               <p>So the Prieſt his lifting up the Hoſt over his head, as if it were an Heave-Offering: and that late Abomination, that they muſt do it on the north ſide of the Communion Table or Altar, as they love to have it called.</p>
               <p>To reintroduce theſe old legal Ceremonies, and to talk of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Sacrifices under the Goſpel, is to dig <hi>Moſes</hi> out of his Grave, and to deny Jeſus Chriſt: there is more evil in ſuch things, then many do imagine or will believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Exhortation to keep cloſe to the Command of God, in all the matters of his Worſhip. Conſider the 38 Verſe of this Chapter: <hi>This is the Law of the Burnt-Offering, and of the Meat-Offering,</hi> (and ſo of all the reſt of their Offerings) <hi>which the Lord commanded</hi> Moſes <hi>in Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>in the day that he commanded the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to offer their Oblations to the Lord, in the Wilderneſs of</hi> Sinai.</p>
               <p>The manner of Worſhip is under a Command, as well as the matter: the Mode of Worſhip hath <hi>a Law,</hi> which muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and obſerved and kept cloſe unto.</p>
               <p>Let me preſs this Exhortation, that you would in all your Worſhip keep cloſe unto the Rule of the Word, with theſe four Motives.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It hath been the great deſign of Satan in all times and Ages, to defile and corrupt the Worſhip of God: if he cannot perſwade men to be downright Atheiſts, and to ſay, there is no God; he labours then to drive them into the other extream of Idolatry and Superſtition, and to impoſe upon them with an Image, with an Idol, in ſtead of God; and the hearts of men are like Tinder, to the fire of theſe temptations.</p>
               <p>The Stratagem hath been I think, as ſucceſsful and as advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:96313:180"/>
to the Devils Kingdom, as any that ever came into that Old Serpents head.</p>
               <p>When, or how ſoon this deluſion came into the world, I need not here diſpute. Certain it is, it was very early; for we have expreſs mention made of it amongſt <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Anceſtors, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.2. Now the Call of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was but four hundred twenty-ſeven years after the Flood, or thereabout; as you will find, if you compute and put together the Ages of thoſe ten Patriarchs, recorded <hi>Gen.</hi> 11, with <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.5. So that mankind having been cut down with a Flood but a little before, for Atheiſtical profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wickedneſs; they were loſt again, and the whole world in a manner overwhelmed, and drowned (as it were) with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and worſer Deluge of Idolatry, within that ſhort ſpace of four hundred years or thereabouts: for unto that Period as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the Riſe of Idolatry muſt be referred. And what was the great ſin amongſt the <hi>Jews?</hi> Was it not this? And amongſt the old Heathens and Pagans, and amongſt the Papiſts, and other ſuperſtitious Chriſtians at this day? What is the great Deſign and Work of Chriſt in this Age, the work of this Generation, but to bring forth his Worſhip into purity, that the new <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> may come down from Heaven? This therefore Satan ſtudies chiefly to oppoſe, and ſo to countermine the Lord Jeſus in his great Work. And will you take part with him, and be on his ſide againſt the Lord?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will be varniſhed over with fair colours and plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſes; departing from the Will of God, revealed in his Word, in the matter of his Worſhip, hath ever been ſo. The Image that fell down from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> (cryed they <hi>Act.</hi> 19.35.) this was given out for that <hi>Epheſian Diana:</hi> ſo the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> gives the Wine of her Fornication in a golden Cup. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.4. And as the Light increaſeth: ſo the Crafts and Methods of Satan are more refined, and more ſubtile and ſpiritual. In the firſt times of the New Teſtament, he did appear almoſt like himſelf in the ſhape of a great Red Dragon in the <hi>Roman Pagan</hi> Emperors: but when <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels overcame and overthrew him in this appearance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. Then he puts on a new Vizard, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:96313:181"/>
in another ſhape of two wild Beaſts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. but ſtill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues the ſame deſign, though under new pretences, and by other Inſtruments, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Church and Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> For he hath made it his buſineſs ever ſince the time of <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> to revive the old Heatheniſh Idolatry under other names, that the world might not be ſaid <hi>Idola relinquere,</hi> but <hi>ſimulacra mutaſſe;</hi> that whereas before they worſhipped the Devil under the names of <hi>Jupiter, Diana</hi> and <hi>Apollo, &amp;c.</hi> now they commit the ſame Idolatry, and worſhip the ſame Devil ſtill; but under the names of <hi>popiſh Saints.</hi> Now it is not <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> any more, but St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and St. <hi>Becket,</hi> and <hi>the Vicar of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>the holy Catholick Church of</hi> Rome; thus doth that Harlot paint her face: ſo the prelatick Superſtitions at this day, thoſe Reliques of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are painted over with thoſe glozing pretences of <hi>Antiquity, Fathers, Councils, Order, Decency, Edification, the Peace of the Church,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If once you leave the Rule of the Word, the will of God revealed there, and begin in a way of Superſtition, you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know where to ſtop or ſtay, nor where to make an end; but you will multiply your Idols, and increaſe your Idolatries, and grow worſe and worſe.</p>
               <p>As in thoſe ſenſual luſts of drunkenneſs and uncleanneſs, the poor Creature ſaith, <hi>I will ſeek it yet again:</hi> ſo in theſe ſpiritual luſts they are <hi>unſatiable,</hi> Ezek. 16.28. <hi>becauſe thou waſt unſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> It is an endleſs ſin.</p>
               <p>If you do but wear a <hi>Surplice</hi> for peace ſake, why not as well admit the Sign of the Croſs in Baptiſme, or bow to an Altar? And then within a little while, the ſame reaſon is as ſtrong for bowing to an <hi>Image,</hi> to a <hi>Crucifix;</hi> and why not as well ſay <hi>Maſs</hi> too, for the peace of the Church? And then at laſt, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low down every thing, ſubmit your Conſciences to the Pope, worſhip the Beaſt, and ſo be damned and go to Hell, and all for the peace of the Church. O there is no end here, but like a man that is tumbling down a ſteep Hill, that cannot ſtop till he come to the bottom.</p>
               <p>Popery came in by degrees; the firſt four Trumpets made
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:96313:181"/>
way for the perfection of that Apoſtaſie that came in by the fifth.</p>
               <p>Among the Idolatrous Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thoſe in ſucceeding times were worſe then their wicked Predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was bad enough; but he only ſets up the two Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel:</hi> but <hi>Omri</hi> went beyond him, for it is ſaid, <hi>he did worſe then all that went before him.</hi> 1 King. 16.25. We read of <hi>the Statutes of</hi> Omri. <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.16. Idolatrous and perſecuting Laws. But his Son <hi>Ahab</hi> was worſe then he. <hi>For, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the ſins of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>he did ſet up the Worſhip of</hi> Baal, <hi>and did more to provoke the God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to anger, then all the Kings of</hi> Iſrael <hi>that went before him.</hi> 1 King. 16.31, 32, 33. So that you ſee it is an increaſing and an endleſs ſin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All the honour men do, or think they do to God by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of their own invention, doth redound indeed, and in truth to the honour of the Devil, which is a fearful thing to conſider.</p>
               <p>Superſtition is a ſin directly againſt the means of worſhip; but it is ultimately againſt the Object of worſhip. Strange worſhip ſets up a ſtrange God:<note place="margin">Ames <hi>Med. Theol. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 14, 15, 42.</note> for it neceſſarily ſuppoſeth and feigneth to it ſelf, ſuch an Object of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as is well pleaſed with ſuch manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as Superſtition offers up: and to whoſe will ſoever we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our Conſciences, as the Rule of our religious worſhip, him we ſet up as our God. Though it be not ſo in mens intentions; yet it is ſo indeed, and in Gods Interpretation. The Lord ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets falſe worſhip, that a new God is deviſed for the Object of it: ſo of the Heatheniſh Idolatry, <hi>the things which the Gentiles ſacrifice, they ſacrifice to Devils, and not to God.</hi> 1 Cor. 10.20. And ſo the Lord interprets the Jewiſh Idolatry; <hi>Jeroboam ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prieſts for the Devils which he had made.</hi> 2 Chron. 11.15. Lev. 17.7. Deut. 32.17.</p>
               <p>And he puts the ſame conſtruction upon the Popiſh Idolatry, <hi>they repented not of worſhipping Devils.</hi> Rev. 9.20. And their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Emiſſaries are called <hi>Spirits of Devils.</hi> Rev. 16.14. they think they worſhip St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> yea God himſelf and Jeſus Chriſt; but it is indeed and in Gods account, the Devil whom they worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:96313:182"/>It is true, you cannot honour God too much, his Name is above and beyond all praiſe: but you may miſtake and honour the Devil, when you think you honour God. A fearful miſtake indeed it is; but yet it is that which all thoſe fall into, who in their worſhip, depart from the will of God revealed in his Word, and turn aſide to any of the Inventions of men.</p>

               <p>IN the diſtribution I formerly gave of the Ceremonial Law, you may remember, I did put the Legal Sacrifices and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications together under one Head, as partaking in the ſame general nature; both of them tending to the purging away of ſin, and of uncleanneſs; Moral uncleanneſs being taken away by Sacrifice; Ceremonial uncleanneſs by Ceremonial Purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereof we are now to ſpeak as the Lord ſhall enable us, from this Text, which ſpeaks very fully and moſt divinely to this Point.</p>
               <p>There be two things in the Text.</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:96313:182"/>

               </list>
               <p>Under each of which, there be three particulars which are here ſet by the Apoſtle, in a way of oppoſite correſpondency the one to the other.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſpeaks of <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> in the Type. To which anſwers <hi>dead works,</hi> as the thing figured by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He mentions Ceremonial <hi>cleanſing to the purifying of the fleſh.</hi> To which anſwers <hi>the purging of the Conſcience from dead Works, to ſerve the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Means of the one, anſwers to the Means of the other: <hi>The blood of Bulls and Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unclean,</hi> which is the Means of legal cleanſing. To this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers <hi>the blood of Chriſt, who by the eternal Spirit, offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without ſpot unto God,</hi> which is the Means of ſpiritual cleanſing.</p>
               <p>Though withall the Apoſtle ſhews, that theſe two anſwer not each other in a way of equal Analogy, there being indeed a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent excellency of the one above the other, of the Antitype above the Type: therefore he expreſſeth it with an <hi>how much more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thoſe legal Purifications, attain the end of legal cleanſing for which they were appointed; how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt cleanſe the Conſcience? It hath a greater efficacy, and is a Truth of clearer and higher Evidence.</p>
               <p>Theſe particulars of the Analogy between the Type and the Antitype, we may caſt them into three doctrinal Propoſitions thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they had a Ceremonial uncleanneſs under the Law, which figured the Moral uncleanneſs of dead works.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they had alſo Ceremonial cleanſings or purifyings of the fleſh, which ſignified the purging our Conſciences from dead works, to ſerve the living God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Means of Ceremonial putification by the blood of Bulls and Goats, and by the aſhes of an Heiſer ſprinkling the unclean, ſignified the blood of Chriſt, who by the eternal Spirit, offered up himſelf without ſpot unto God.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:96313:183"/>1. For the firſt, namely, that they had a Ceremonial unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under the Law, which did figure out the Moral uncleanneſs of dead works: therefore he ſets them one againſt the other: ſo that thoſe uncleanneſſes did ſignify dead works: and what is meant by dead works, we may ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. <hi>not laying again the foundation of Repentance from dead works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What do we repent of? We repent of our ſins. Theſe are therefore the dead works here ſpoken of, and ſin is called a dead work, becauſe it proceeds from death, and is a part of ſpiritual death, and tends to eternal death. As good Actions tend to life, ſo ſin tends to death: ſo then Ceremonial uncleanneſs, ſignifies Moral uncleanneſs of ſin and dead works.</p>
               <p>There were two or three ſorts of Ceremonial uncleanneſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Unclean Touchings. 2. Unclean Iſſues. 3. That unclean Diſeaſe of the Leproſy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They had unclean Touchings and Taſtings: here was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs from without.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They had unclean Iſſues: here was uncleanneſs from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a mans ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Diſeaſe of the Leproſy, was a Diſeaſe of Ceremonial uncleanneſs: and here was both an inward and an outward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was a Ceremonial uncleanneſs by eating or touching any unclean thing, <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. In that Chapter it is treated of: which Chapter, ſhews what Beaſts, what Fiſhes, what Fowls, and what creeping things might, and what might not be eaten. And it is ſaid of thoſe that might not be eaten, <hi>Whoſoever touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Carcaſe of them, ſhall be unclean.</hi> Verſ. 24.</p>
               <p>And this was a thing of ſo great weight, that the Lord uſes thoſe vehement expreſſions about it. <hi>Ye ſhall not make your ſelves abominable with any of thoſe unclean things and creeping things,</hi> &amp;c. 43. verſe of that Chapter. <hi>For I am the Lord your God; you ſhall therefore ſanctify your ſelves.</hi> It did make the perſon abominable, who did defile himſelf with thoſe things.</p>
               <p>We read of two kinds of uncleanneſs of Beaſts under the Law.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was an Uncleanneſs of Beaſts for Sacrifice, and an Uncleanneſs of Beaſts for Food.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:96313:183"/>That diſtinction of Clean and Unclean referred to Sacrifices, that was from the firſt entrance of Sin into the World. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time, there were ſo many Clean and ſo many Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Beaſts with him in the Ark.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The uncleanneſs of the Beaſts for Meat ſeems now to be appointed by God, there having been a more general liberty in the time of <hi>Noah,</hi> and ever ſince, to eat of any wholeſom living Creature; God now laid a reſtraint upon it by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why ſuch a difference? Is not every Creature of God good?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are good in themſelves. It is not any natural Uncleanneſs, but an inſtituted Uncleanneſs; that Uncleanneſs that is in them by virtue of the Ceremonial Law.</p>
               <p>And the Reaſon is, The abſolute ſupream authority and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of God over all his Creatures.</p>
               <p>He would have all men know, That whatſoever they eat it is by his allowance, and they muſt forbear ſo far as he reſtrains them.</p>
               <p>And this further account may be given of it: That it did make up and ſtrengthen that Partition Wall between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> which the Lord thought good to ſet up in thoſe times. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> being unconvinced of any ſuch things, and the <hi>Jews</hi> being ſtrictly trained up to it.</p>

               <p>And there be three Rules obſervable about the Beaſts which were Clean and which were Unclean; which might be eaten and touched and which might not; and they were known thus.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By the parting the Hoof.</item>
                  <item>2. By chewing the Cud.</item>
                  <item>3. By the properties and diſpoſitions of them.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Such as parted the Hoof were Clean. <hi>Levit.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever parteth the Hoof, and is cloven footed among the Beaſts, that ſhall ye eat.</hi> And they that did not were Unclean.</p>
               <p>This plainly notes a right diſtinguiſhment of things that God requires of his people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:96313:184"/>That we ſhould walk in them with a right foot, diſtinguiſhing of things that differ. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>And this I pray, that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and in all judgment, that ye may approve things that are excellent.</hi> The Margin ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it thus. That you may diſcern of things that differ. For many things there are of a different nature which a Chriſtian ſhould diſtinguiſh; as the difference between the Law and the Goſpel; between our general and particular Callings; that there be not an intrenching of the one upon the other. This is one property, the parting of the Hoof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond is the chewing of the Cud, which intimates Meditation, ruminating on the things of God, digeſting Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Food; for the Word is compared to Food. <hi>Amos</hi> 8.12. <hi>I will ſend a Famin in the Land; not a Famin of Bread, nor a thirſt for Water, but of hearing the Words of the Lord.</hi> The Word of God is Spiritual, and it muſt be chewed and ruminated upon by deep and ſerious Meditation. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in Gods Law day and night. Luk.</hi> 2.19. It is ſpoken in the praiſe of <hi>Mary,</hi> that <hi>ſhe pondered on thoſe things, and laid them up in her heart.</hi> It is the miſery of Sinners and unclean Creatures; that they cannot ponder the path of Life. Prov. 5.6. <hi>Her feet go down to death, her ſteps take hold on hell, leſt thou ſhouldſt pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the path of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The want of a meditating conſidering frame of heart undoes poor ſinners, they cannot conſider what they do, they are not ſerious in meditating and ruminating on the word of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a third difference and character between the Clean and the Unclean, and that is, in the properties of each. Some had good properties, and ſome bad. As the Swine, which wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men are compared unto, for that fowl and dirty diſpoſition and property of wallowing in the Mire. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. <hi>The Dog is turned to his vomit, and the Sow that is waſhed, to her wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that as the Dog licks up his vomit again; ſo many a poor Sinner that hath been waſhed and made clean, and hath confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ſins, and vomited up his filthineſs, he licks it up again,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:96313:184"/>
and returns to the ſame ſin he had vomited up by confeſſion, like the Dog and Swine.</p>
               <p>This uncleanneſs of the Beaſts did intimate two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A diſtinction of perſons.</item>
                  <item>2. The neceſſity of forbearing Communion with ſome kind of perſons.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. That there is a difference of perſons, clean and unclean Men, which is intimated by clean and unclean Beaſts.</p>
               <p>It is common in Scripture to ſpeak of men under ſuch reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, and eſpecially wicked men, to compare them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Beaſts. We ſee it in <hi>Peters</hi> Viſion. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. <hi>He ſaw all manner of four-footed Beaſts and creeping things, &amp;c. verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>What God hath cleanſed, call not thou common nor unclean.</hi> And ſo here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon when <hi>Peter</hi> was meditating on this Viſion, the Spirit ſaid unto him, <hi>go down with theſe men, doubting nothing, for I have ſent thee.</hi> And he had incouragement to go and preach to the Gentiles by that Viſion.</p>
               <p>This Sheet let down with unclean Beaſts ſignifies the <hi>Gentile people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a great diſtinction in the Godly themſelves, and much more in Wicked and Ungodly Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> repreſented the four Monarchies by four Beaſts. The Lyon of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Bear of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Leopard of <hi>Greece,</hi> and the <hi>Roman Monſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſpeaks thus much: That ſome perſons are clean, and ſome are unclean, godly and ungodly, clean and unclean.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It beſpeaks a reſtraint of Communion with wicked men.</p>
               <p>Eating is an action of Communion, and not eating implies a reſtraint of Communion. Therefore when it is ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> kill and eat, the meaning is, go and communicate with the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Communion with Chriſt is ſet forth by eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>eating his fleſh, and drinking his blood,</hi> having inward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him thereby.</p>
               <p>So to eat, or not to eat of ſuch and ſuch Beaſts is to have Communion, or not to have Communion with ſuch or ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:96313:185"/>
Some men muſt be abſtained from as unclean, that is wicked and ungodly men, the neglect whereof God often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.7. <hi>He reproves them, that they had let in ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into his Sanctuary.</hi> And verſ. 23. <hi>They ſhall teach my people the difference between the Holy and Profane, and cauſe them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between the unclean and the clean.</hi> Men of unclean and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Lives, are unclean as to ſpiritual Communion: but men of ſound Judgments and good Lives, are perſons fit to converſe with.</p>
               <p>Under the Law they had unclean and clean Meats, and they contracted uncleanneſs or not, by touching or not touching.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort of Uncleanneſs, was the unclean Iſſues.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There was alſo the unclean Diſeaſe of Leproſy; as in <hi>Lev.</hi> 13. and the cleanſing of it, <hi>Cap</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Here is a further diſcovery of ſome of the popiſh Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions: you may here obſerve both the Riſe and the evil of them.</p>
               <p>Three things there be that are ſtill retained amongſt them, and other ſuperſtitious Chriſtians that retain ſome remnants of <hi>Baal,</hi> popiſh Superſtitions in the worſhip of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The difference of Meats: not to eat ſuch and ſuch Meats, at leaſt not at ſuch or ſuch times. They borrowed this from the Ceremonial Law: ſome things might be eaten, ſome not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They have their Holy Water: and this they had from the Water of Separation ſpoken of here, the aſhes of an Heifer ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Unclean, mentioned <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. which Water, was a Water of ſeparation made of the aſhes of an Heifer, and with this they ſprinkled the Unclean, which ſanctified them when they had eaten or touched any unclean thing, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls Holy Water. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:96313:185"/>Now this device of Holy Water they had from thence, a fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and ridiculous device it is in them, being wholly without any warrant from the word of God in New Teſtament times.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is the <hi>Purification,</hi> or <hi>Churching of Women</hi> after Child birth. An apiſh Imitation of that old legal Ordinance of God, in <hi>Lev.</hi> 12. for the Purification of Women.</p>
               <p>In the Book of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> they have omitted ſome groſs things, but retain the Title, Churching of Women, and order the Woman to ſpeak in the Church, and ſay the 116, or 127. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> wherein too they leave the good and ſound Tranſlation which we have in our Bibles, and follow a corrupt one, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they make the Woman talk of giving a reward unto the Lord: and moreover they appoint abſurd broken Reſponds and toſſings of their Prayers like Tennis Balls, as is common with them alſo in other of their <hi>Offices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Riſe of theſe Superſtitions is, they are borrowed from thoſe things which were once Ordinances, but now are Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, becauſe the Stamp of God is taken from them.</p>
               <p>That Command is not now in force, but is abrogated by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Subſtance Jeſus Chriſt which is now come.</p>
               <p>And as you ſee the Riſe of them: ſo alſo the aboliſhment of them under the Goſpel. For if they were Types and Shadows of ſpiritual uncleanneſs, and ſpiritual cleanſing by the blood of Chriſt (as you ſee the Apoſtle here interprets them) they muſt needs be ceaſed, now that Chriſt is come: therefore our Saviour ſaith, <hi>that which entreth into a man, cannot defile a man.</hi> Mat. 15.11, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Whatſoever entreth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is caſt out unto the draught; but thoſe things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart, and they defile the man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How contrary are ſuch words, to the retaining of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Meats? <hi>Every Creature of God is good, if it be received with thankſgiving; for it is ſanctified by the word of God and Prayer.</hi> 1 Tim. 4.4. <hi>It is good that the heart be eſtabliſhed with Grace, and not with Meats, which have not profited them that have been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied therein.</hi> Heb. 13.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:96313:186"/>A man may eat any thing that is wholeſome, if it be not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account, that there is ſome hurtfulneſs in it.</p>
               <p>But theſe Popiſh Superſtitions are borrowed from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in the practice of them, men implicitely deny that Chriſt is come, and hath cleanſed our Conſciences by his own blood, from dead works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. See here the miſerable pollution of our hearts by nature. This was the thing intended and aimed at in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> theſe legal Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the water of ſeparation ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctify to the purifying of the fleſh: how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt purge your Conſciences from dead works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a ſpiritual defilement on the hearts of ſinners by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and this was exhibited and ſhown by theſe legal Shadows.</p>
               <p>Take notice then what unclean Creatures you are by nature.</p>
               <p>There is a threefold degree of ſpiritual uncleanneſs upon us, in an unregenerate eſtate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is external infection and defilement from without: every thing we touch defiles, and is defiled by us in our natural condition; <hi>the very ploughing of the wicked is ſin, his prayer is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If carnal men touch any Ordinance, they defile it; if they come into the houſe of God, they pollute his Sanctuary. There is a fearful defilement on the Souls and Conſciences of men, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Every thing that a wicked man hath to do withal it defiles him, and he defiles it. <hi>To the pure, everything is pure,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but to the unclean, every thing is unclean.</hi> That is, a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, every thing infects and hurts him, he receives a ſecret ſpiritual impreſſion as it were, of hurt and defilement from it: and doth alſo defile whatever he meddles with, eſpecially the perſons they converſe with.</p>
               <p>A wicked man leaves a defilement on thoſe he converſes with, and he is defiled by them. One wicked man corrupts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects another: we ſee it in bad Company how they infect, and are infected by one another mutually.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>take heed leſt there be any Fornicator, or any profane
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:96313:186"/>
perſon among you, any root of bitterneſs ſpringing up and ſo many be defiled</hi> Heb. 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There be unclean Iſſues, running Sores. <hi>Iſaia</hi> 1.5, 6. putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Sores, no ſound part.</p>
               <p>And what is this but the out-breaking of Corruption in actual ſins. Original ſin is like a corrupt Fountain, and actual ſins are unclean, and evil, and bitter ſtreams that iſſue from it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is an unclean Leproſie in the heart of every carnal man, which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of and deplores in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one the plague of his own heart,</hi> or the leproſie of his own heart: The ſame word that is vſed in <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>And hence it follows (4.) that they are unworthy and uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to converſe in holy things, and to draw near to God in his Ordinances. For the unclean perſon was to be ſeparated during the time of his uncleanneſs till purified and made clean again.</p>
               <p>

               <p>The ſprinkling of the Unclean ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh: The blood of Chriſt purgeth the Conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God.</p>
               <p>If we cannot ſee theſe divine myſteries in the Text; if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee Goſpel-Truths in theſe legal Ceremonies, and how admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably they are adapted and fitted the one to the other; the Type to inſtruct and teach us, and inform us about the Anti-type, it is becauſe of our own darkneſs and dimſightedneſs in ſpiritual things.</p>

Behold alſo the pre-eminence and excellency of Chriſt above <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Goſpel above the Law. <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt purge your Conſciences from dead works?</hi> [How much more?] It hath a greater and an irreſiſtible efficacy, to cleanſe the Soul &amp; Conſcience. And this is a Truth of clearer and higher evidence than the Ceremonial cleanneſs by thoſe legal waſhings and purifications, which were the means of that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Cleanneſs.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle uſes the like note of pre-eminence when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares

               <p>Thou that haſt an unclean heart, and haſt lived it may be an unclean life (at leaſt in ſecret) though perhaps men have not ſeen it, get thy Heart, and Life, and Conſcience purified from dead works to ſerve the living God. There is healing cleanſing vertue enough in the blood of Chriſt. And would you be cleanſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? you ſee the way of it. Hath the Lord diſcovered to thee thy defilement, and convinced thee of thy own uncleanneſs? then get this blood of Chriſt applied. And as the Water of Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication was ſprinkled on the Unclean under the Law; ſo get this blood of Chriſt ſprinkled on thy Soul and Conſcience by the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>It is often called the Blood of ſprinkling. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that as they did apply it by ſprinkling, as a means of cleanſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo is the blood of Chriſt applied to the Conſcience. It is applied by the Spirit in the Promiſe. Under the Promiſe held forth, we receive it by Faith; and the Promiſe ſo received, the blood of Chriſt is brought home and ſprinkled on the Soul; and this will cleanſe thee, though thou have been never ſo unclean, there is healing purifying vertue in that blood, though thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs be never ſo great, and thy Conſcience never ſo defiled; yet there is cleanſing by the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thy Caſe is not deſperate; there is vertue enough in the blood of Chriſt. How much more will the blood of Chriſt cleanſe thy Soul, if the blood of Bulls and of Goats, and the aſhes of an Heyfer ſprinkling the unclean could cleanſe the body.</p>

               <p>Or 2.

            <head>An ADVERTISEMENT to the READER.</head>
            <p>THe attentive Reader will quickly obſerve, that here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon that Head of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs by Iſſues which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Authors propoſed method ſhould have been here treated of. But there is not any thing thereon to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Papers, nor to be recovered by the help of any that took in writing theſe Diſcourſes from his mouth. It is therefore not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the Author did purpoſely paſs over in ſilence that Head, for reaſons to him ſatisfactory; which now can be but conjectured at.</p>
            <p>Moreover the Reader is deſired to bear in mind, that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sermon on <hi>Levit. 13.</hi> concerning uncleanneſs by the Leproſy, was not preached in the Authors courſe as it fell in his way in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Types, but ſundry years before, on occaſion of diſpenſing the Cenſure of Excommunication in that Church, whereof the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had the Overſight. This it was thought needful to advertiſe the Reader of, partly becauſe of the different method of this Sermon, from his other diſcourſes on the Types; and partly becauſe ſome Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges therein, evidently refer to the Diſpenſation of that Ordinance, on occaſion whereof it was preached: and partly to account for the date of this Sermon, which the Reader will ſee is ſome years before thoſe that go before it. The like is to be obſerved alſo concerning the foregoing Sermon on Circumciſion, which in this Book is at <hi>Pag. 218.</hi> It was preached on occaſion of the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, as appears by a Paſſage in it, <hi>Pag. 219.</hi> And more then two years before it fell in the Authors way in his going over the Types; yea ſundry Months before he entred on this courſe and ſubject in his Miniſtry.</p>

               <p>BRethren and Beloved in the Lord: If this Chapter ſeem to us at the firſt reading to be a dark and abſtruſe place and to have little edifying matter in it, we muſt impute it to our own ignorance and unskilfulneſs in Scripture Truths and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. It is true: there is a dark ſhadow upon the words. But there is much light, and many uſeful Truths intended and held forth under theſe dark legal ſhadows.</p>
               <p>The ſubject both of this and of ſundry foregoing and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapters is concerning Ceremonial Uncleanneſs, of which there be ſeveral kinds, whereof this of Leproſie is one.</p>
               <p>The general ſcope of this Chapter is to give Rules of tryal whereby to diſcern it.</p>
               <p>The next, <hi>viz.</hi> the 14. Chapter, gives the Rules for cleanſing the Leper. Concerning both which God gives them afterwards a ſtrict and ſolemn charge that they ſhould take heed and obſerve diligently and do according to theſe commands of his concerning the Leproſie. <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:96313:189"/>The Leproſie, and the legal uncleanneſs thereof, was typical. It ſignified and held forth three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sin; which is fitly compared to a Leproſie for the loathſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and painfulneſs and infectiouſneſs of it.</p>
               <p>Yet this is not all. For Sin may be compared to any other diſeaſe as well as to the Leproſie. Any ſore, or ſickneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe whatſoever may ſignifie and hold forth ſin. As <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 6. <hi>full of ſores</hi> — the meaning is Spiritual ſickneſs: They were a <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people</hi>— Mat. 9.12. <hi>The whole need not a Phyſician, but they that are ſick,</hi> that is, ſick of ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore ſecondly it ſignified Original ſin. For the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie overſpreads all. Actual ſins are the Boils and Sores that break forth, but Original ſin is as the Leproſie overſpreading the whole nature.</p>
               <p>Yet this is not all: For this is in the beſt: and therefore if this were all, the people of God might be accounted Lepers. For all have Original ſin; but yet there be ſome that be not Lepers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore thirdly the Leproſie ſignified a ſtate of ſin and unregeneracy. For the Leper muſt be ſhut out of the Camp, from among the people of God, as being none of them, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a ſpot, as is not the ſpot of his people. Therefore it ſeems alſo to hold forth a ſtate of ſin, a ſinful or unregenerate condition.</p>
               <p>Now for the expoſition of this Chapter; to let you ſee a little further into ſome of the Truths and Myſteries contained in it, I ſhall only give you ſome general Obſervations, under which we ſhall explain ſome part of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That it is a work both difficult and weighty for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to diſcern and judge aright of their own ſpiritual condition.</p>
               <p>This appears by all theſe Rules and Directions. Were it not neceſſary, what need of any Rule? were it not difficult, what need of ſo many Rules of tryal about the Leproſie?</p>
               <p>This condemns the ſlightneſs of many that are ſlight and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs about this great work; beſtow few thoughts and cares about it, about ſearching into their Spiritual Condition, as if it were an eaſie or a ſlight matter. It is the exhortation of the Apoſtle
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:96313:189"/>
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. that we ſhould <hi>give diligence to make our Calling and Election ſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That it is the Prieſts Office to judge of the Leproſie. It is the Office of the Miniſters of God to help his people, in diſcerning their own ſpiritual eſtates and conditions towards God: therefore it runs ſo much upon the Prieſt throughout the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Bring him to the Prieſt, and the Prieſt ſhall make him unclean. Defile him, pollute him</hi>— that is, Miniſterially declare him ſo to be. As <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.3, 4. <hi>deſtroy the City</hi>— that is, propheſie its deſtruction.</p>
               <p>God hath given his Miniſters power to retain and remit ſins, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.23. which is the thing intended in this typical work of the Prieſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How ſhould I underſtand without an Interpreter?</hi> Act. 8.31. How could men know the meaning of the Scripture, or apply it aright, without this means which God hath appointed for their help? Ordinarily they cannot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It reproves that reſervedneſs of many, who know not their own condition, whether they be Lepers or no, and yet will not diſcloſe their caſe; whereas it may be the Prieſt might declare and evidence it to them, that they are clean.</p>
               <p>To complain to every one, and to make Table talk of their Corruptions, and ſo to fiſh out praiſes, ſavours of Hypocriſie. But to make known their condition to ſome able faithful friend or Miniſter, eſpecially if in the uſe of other means you cannot attain to a comfortable diſcerning of it, is a duty, through the neglect whereof, ſome are kept long in the dark about their own eſtates. It is often times out of ſhame, their ſins and ſores and ſpiritual Leproſies are loathſome and ſhameful.</p>
               <p>But were it not better to make it known, then to let the ſores of thy Conſcience ſeſter inwardly? Their Wounds ſtink and are corrupt, becauſe of their fooliſhneſs in this particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. Note here (which will carry us through many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the Chapter) the Rules of Tryal, whereby the Prieſt is to judge of the Leproſie.</p>
               <p>There be five Rules eſpecially, which be clear and ſafe to judg of the ſpiritual Leproſie by.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:96313:190"/>1. <hi>If it be but skin deep, it is not the Leproſie, he is clean: but if deeper, he is unclean. Verſ.</hi> 3, 4— and again <hi>Verſ</hi> 20, 25, 30. if it be but skin deep, it is ſome ſin, ſome ſore of a leſſer nature: but if deeper then the skin, in the Vitals, blood, and ſpirits, he is unclean: it is the Leproſie.</p>
               <p>So if there be ſins and corruptions appearing like ſpots in the skin, in a mans outward walkings; yet if the heart be not taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is a good ſign.</p>
               <p>A Child of God may have ſpots in his Skin, frailties in his life; but his heart is ſound, his heart is perfect with God, ſound in his Statutes.</p>
               <p>But there be ſome ſins that go deep, not only in the Skin; but the ſin is deeply rooted in the heart, and ſpirits and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a ſinner; ſo that the Vitals are infected.</p>
               <p>This is a ſign he is a Leper.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Tryal. Doth it ſtand at a ſtay? Or doth it ſpread further and further? <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8. And again <hi>verſ</hi> 23, 27, 28, 34, 36, 37. <hi>If it ſtand at a ſtay, he is clean. If it ſpread, he is a Leper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So a leprous ſinner that is in a ſinful ſtate and condition, the Leproſy will ſpread in him. <hi>Evil men and Deceivers, will grow worſe and worſe.</hi> 2 Tim. 3.13. Their Corruptions gain ground upon them.</p>
               <p>But it is a ſign there is ſome beginning of healing, if it ſtand at a ſtay. If the Lord be healing a ſinner, mortifying his Luſts, he is clean.</p>
               <p>There is ſinful Corruption in a Child of God; but it doth not grow, ſpread, and gather ſtrength from day to day: but on the contrary, it is decaying, it is on the loſing hand. <hi>The houſe of</hi> Saul <hi>grows weaker and weaker; but the houſe of</hi> David <hi>grows ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſtronger.</hi> This is a ſign God intends good to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Tryal is this. <hi>If there be proud raw fleſh in the Riſing,</hi> verſ. 9, 10, 11— and 14, 15. <hi>he is not to be ſhut up in ſuſpenſe, the thing is evident.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how ſhall we apply this to the ſpiritual Leproſy?</p>
               <p>Thus. Is there proud raw fleſh of pride and preſumption and impatience of reproof? This is an evil ſign the ſin is grown to ſome ſtrength.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:96313:190"/>There may be ſores and ſpots in a Child of God; but they are not ſo ſore, as that they will not be toucht; they will bear reproof. As <hi>David</hi> when <hi>Abigail</hi> reproved him. 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 25.32, 33. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>which ſent thee, and bleſſed be thy advice, and bleſſed be thou.</hi> And ſo Pſal. 141.5. <hi>Let the Righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others you cannot touch them, but you muſt be fenſed with Iron, and the Staff of a Spear; <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.6. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.6, 7. Such are the Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> that ſhall all of them as Thorns be thruſt away, and utterly burned with fire.</p>
               <p>When a man cannot bear to be told of it, but his quick raw fleſh appears; it is an ill ſign, he is a Leper indeed.</p>
               <p>Such an one it ſeems <hi>Nabal</hi> was, 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 25.27.</p>
               <p>But where this froward touchineſs is wanting, if a man will take a reproof well, it is a good ſign, it is not the Plague of unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>If all be turned white, a man is clean.</hi> Verſ. 12, 17, and 34. This ſeems to be the ſtrangeſt Rule of all, and the darkeſt Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in all this Chapter: there is ſome difficulty, both concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the natural reaſon, and concerning the ſpiritual meaning of it.</p>
               <p>The natural reaſon ſeems to be this; becauſe it is a ſign of ſome inward ſtrength of nature, that it expells the Diſeaſe, and ſends it forth to the outward parts.</p>
               <p>Whereas if there be raw ſpots among it; it argues it is more inward, and the Vitals not ſo ſtrong as to drive it forth.</p>
               <p>The ſpiritual meaning is by ſome thought to be this; if all become white by true repentance and mortification, then it is not deadly.</p>
               <p>But this is too general: therefore it ſeems to intend this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that if we think there be any ſound part in our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is a ſign of a Leprous ſinner: ſo <hi>Ainſw. in loc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If men have any confidence in themſelves, if they ſeek any life by the deeds of the Law, then ſhall they be pronounced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean. But an humble acknowledgment of the overſpreading cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our natures, and flying to Chriſt for help under a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough conviction and ſenſe of our own total uncleanneſs and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutedneſs;
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:96313:191"/>
this is a ſign the Plague is healed, and the Leper made clean.</p>
               <p>The language of a Child of God is, <hi>There is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh.</hi> Pſal. 38.7. And <hi>in me, that is in my fleſh, there dwelleth no good thing.</hi> Rom. 7.18.</p>
               <p>The Opinion of Free will is a very dangerous Opinion. But if a man be throughly convinced of his own Corruption, and ſoundly humbled under it, it will make him look up earneſtly, and cleave firmly to Jeſus Chriſt to make him clean. It is the moſt dangerous thing in the world to take up high conceits of a mans ſelf, and of the power of corrupt nature. This is a ſure Rule, if people think themſelves clean, and any part in them ſound, they are in a ſad condition.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>In caſe the Leproſie be in the Head he is doubly unclean</hi> verſ. 44. The Head is the principal part of the body, and the feat of Reaſon. Therefore a Leproſie there muſt needs be very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
               <p>So in caſe men be corrupt in their Minde and Judgments, they are <hi>unclean, unclean.</hi> Corrupt Opinions are a ſign of a ſinful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; ſuch are <hi>far from the Kingdom of God.</hi> Where ſin has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſo far, as to blind the very Mind and Underſtanding, they are more uncapable of Converſion than others, becauſe ſo far from Conviction: For Converſion begins in Illumination.</p>
               <p>There may be failings in the lives of the people of God: But they diſown them; they are not ſo corrupt in their Minds and Principles as to juſtifie themſelves in them.</p>
               <p>There be ſeveral other Rules in the Chapter; ſome relating to the bodily Diſeaſe, and ſo not neceſſary to ſeek out a Spiritual meaning of each particular expreſſion: And the ſame Rules in the firſt 17 Verſes are repeated again in other caſes of the Leproſie, in Clothes, in Skins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us therefore proceed to a fourth Obſervation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. Note the duties impoſed upon the Leper, when thus detected, they are five. <hi>verſ.</hi> 45, 46, 47.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To rend his Clothes:</hi> a ſign of ſorrow and lamentation: ſo 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.30. The Kings Clothes were rent in that Famine.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:96313:191"/>2. <hi>His Head muſt be bare:</hi> For the ſame end, this being ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward expreſſion of ſorrow, uſual in thoſe times.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He muſt cover his Lip:</hi> Thus they were wont ſo to expreſs their ſhame, ſee <hi>Mica.</hi> 3.7 — <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.17.</p>
               <p>He muſt keep ſilence before God, as being under ſhame and confuſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>He muſt cry unclean, unclean:</hi> He muſt give warning to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to ſhun him. He may ſpeak of his own Leproſie, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he muſt be ſilent.</p>
               <p>So a ſcandalous Sinner may ſpeak in confeſſion of his ſin, he muſt tell others he is unclean. He muſt not charge others with their failings, but load his own Conſcience, and take his guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs home to himſelf.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>He ſhall dwell alone:</hi> They were to be put out of the Camp, and excluded from the fellowſhip of Gods People. The Prieſt muſt ſhut him out and he muſt ſubmit. So King <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> did. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.20.</p>
               <p>This was a Type of Excommunication, that great Goſpel Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, which is, the ſhutting of a ſinner out of the Camp.</p>
               <p>This brings me to ſpeak of Excommunication, which is ſuitable to the preſent Providence. For this ſhutting out the Leper from the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſignified ſhutting out of the Church.</p>
               <p>This therefore I ſhall ſpeak a little to, both the Text and the preſent Providence of God leading and calling to it, under theſe five heads.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The nature of it</item>
                  <item>2. The caſes wherein it muſt be done.</item>
                  <item>3. The ends and uſes of it.</item>
                  <item>4. The manner of proceeding.</item>
                  <item>5. To whom this work and power belongs.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. For the nature of Excommunication. It is the putting of a Man out of the Church, and delivering him unto Satan. <hi>Put away from among you that wicked Perſons</hi> 1 Cor. 5. <hi>ult.</hi> So <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> 3 Joh. 10. <hi>caſt the Brethren out of the Church.</hi> There is a going out of the Church, when men rend themſelves off by Apoſtaſie, Hereſie, or Schiſm. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. <hi>they went out from us</hi>— In
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:96313:192"/>
which they are active, and cut off themſelves, that is their own act; but in this they are ſufferers, this is the Churches act by the power of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For as perſons are united by conſent into ſpiritual fellowſhip: ſo by the Churches diſſent, to have him be of them any longer, he is cut off, or caſt out; upon which he falls into the hand of Satan unavoidably. <hi>Delivering him unto Satan.</hi> 1 Cor. 5.5.</p>
               <p>For the Church is the viſible Kingdom of Chriſt in this World: therefore when caſt out of that, they fall into the hand of Satan who is the God of this World; if put out of Chriſts Kingdom, and from under his gracious Scepter; they muſt needs fall under the Kingdom and power of Satan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What power of Satan is this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not a bodily Poſſeſſion; becauſe the Apoſtle writes to the whole Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to do it.</p>
               <p>But it cannot be ſuppoſed, that the whole Church had the gift of Miracles: neither indeed is the Lord wonted to work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles for that end. We do not find it in Scripture, that the Lord doth put men by Miracle into Satans hand, but he rather works miraculouſly to deliver them from it.</p>
               <p>But a ſpiritual power of Satan over them is hereby meant, namely, either to terrifie or ſtupefie them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes he gives Satan a terrifying power in order to their humbling.</p>
               <p>But, 2. If they be not terrified by Satan, when under this Ordinance, there is a ſtupefying hardning power: and there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any man juſtly Excommunicated, but fell under one of theſe two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What are the Caſes wherein Excommunication ought to be adminiſtred?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It being the higheſt Cenſure, and the ſevereſt part of that ſpiritual vengeance which the Lord hath intruſted his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Churches with; it ſhould never be uſed but in Caſes of great extremity, when no other means in the ordinary courſe of Gods diſpenſation, will attain the end.</p>
               <p>But when the ſinners Caſe is ſuch, that it is beyond the reach
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:96313:192"/>
of other means to help. <hi>Immeditabile vulnus enſe recidendum eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is not to be uſed for meer ſailings, and infirmities, and ſins of weakneſs, which a Godly man may fall into, and yet walk with God uprightly.</p>
               <p>But for ſuch ſins and evils as are inconſiſtent with Grace here, or Glory hereafter: ſuch, as if a man lives and dyes and goes on in; it is not poſſible he ſhould have any Grace in his heart, or any grounded comfort or hope of Salvation.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo it is not to be uſed for things doubtful and diſpute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. much leſs for things indifferent; for they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commend us, nor diſcommend us unto God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8. and therefore ſhould not to the Church. For in ſuch things, we are not either the better or the worſe for practiſing or forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: as the Apoſtle there expreſly aſſerts.</p>
               <p>But for things clear and certain, and univerſally acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt all that deſerve the name of Chriſtians: the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks clearly to two Caſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Fundamental errors of Judgment.</hi> So the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> dealt with <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus.</hi> And what they held, is more particularly expreſſed in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17, 18. viz. <hi>that the Reſurrection is paſt already.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Titus 3.10. <hi>An Heretick after his being twice admoniſhed reject:</hi> ſo here Lev. 13.44. <hi>if the Leproſie be in the head, he is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unclean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence therefore, if any man deny one God and three Perſons, deny the Scriptures, the Deity of Chriſt, the Immortality of the Soul, the Reſurrection of the body, or ſuch like fundamental points; it is the duty of the Church to caſt him out from among them; he is unclean.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For ſcandalous practiſes in a mans life and converſation.</hi> The Rule is plain, 2 Theſſ. 3.6. <hi>Withdraw your ſelves from every bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that walketh diſorderly:</hi> ſo in the caſe of the inceſtuous <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. <hi>put away from among your ſelves that wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> So Mat. 18.17. So of old, 2 Chron. 23.19. Jehoiada <hi>ſet Porters at the Gates of the houſe of the Lord, that none which was unclean in any thing ſhould enter in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:96313:193"/>This includes Moral as well as Ceremonial uncleanneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. The ends of this Ordinance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are many: The principal are theſe three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To vindicate the name of God from the diſhonor done to it by wicked men creeping in among his people.</hi> This vindicates the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of God, that though he loves ſinners, yet he ſhews his love in ſanctifying and turning them from their ſins, not in ſheltering and encouraging them in their wickedneſs. This end is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>It is commonly reported that there is Fornication among you, and that ſuch Fornication as is not ſo much as named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles.</hi> q. d. The name of God ſuffers by it: The <hi>Gentiles</hi> take offence againſt Religion becauſe of this; they are ready to ſay as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.20. <hi>theſe are the Lords people.</hi> And ſo the holy name of God is profaned by ſuch ſinners, as the Prophet there ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>So again, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. <hi>what clearing of your ſelves?</hi> In clearing themſelves they clear the name of God.</p>
               <p>I mention this firſt, becauſe this is the great and chief end of this Ordinance. And it never fails of attaining this end, though it have little ſucceſs in other reſpects: Though the ſinner be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo obſtinate, yet however the name of God is cleared.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For the Churches good,</hi> to take away infectious perſons from amongſt them, and ſo to preſerve and warn the reſt; to keep the Church pure and free from infection. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. One root of bitterneſs may defile many. Heb.</hi> 12.15.</p>
               <p>And to warn others, <hi>that others may fear.</hi> 1 Tim. 5.20. <hi>That all</hi> Iſrael <hi>may hear and fear, and do no more preſumptuouſly.</hi> Deut. 17.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>For the good of the ſinner himſelf,</hi> to bring him to Repentance. <hi>For the deſtruction of the fleſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> muſt be delivered unto Satan, <hi>for the deſtruction of the fleſh.</hi> And God did ſo bleſs this Ordinance to him, that he was humbled, and brought to deep and thorough repentance thereby.</p>
               <p>I confeſs this end is not always attained: But yet the Ordinance is not in vain. For this is not the only end of it, nor yet the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:96313:193"/>
chief end. For Gods glory is the chief end, the vindicating his great name, the manifeſting his juſtiee, and holineſs, and hatred of ſin; and this end is attained, though the ſinner is not converted by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. What is the manner of proceeding in Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Some things herein are left to Chriſtian prudence, and muſt be judged of by the particular circumſtances of every caſe.</p>
               <p>But there be ſome general Rules to guide us in each particular.</p>
               <p>There is chiefly this general Rule wherein all agree, all the godly learned that have written upon this ſubject do agree thus far.</p>
               <p>That in ſome caſes there ought to be a more gradual and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory kind of proceeding by certain ſteps and degrees: But in other caſes the proceedings of the Church may be more ſpeedy and ſummary.</p>
               <p>Rule 1. <hi>In ſome caſes there ought to be a more gradual and dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory way of proceeding by certain ſteps and degrees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ſteps and degrees are two. Firſt <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> and then <hi>Excommunication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt degree is called by ſome the <hi>leſſer Excommunication.</hi> And the ſecond they call the <hi>greater Excommunication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> is a temporary debarring of a perſon from the preſent enjoyment and participation of Church priviledges. As the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and power of Voting, till ſuch time as his Caſe be fully determined.</p>
               <p>Some call it <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> others call it <hi>Admonition,</hi> others the <hi>leſſer Excommunication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he is a Member ſtill.</p>
               <p>For Excommunication cuts him off; Suſpenſion only debars him of preſent communion with the Body for a time: But Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication cuts off and diſſolves his union with the Body.</p>
               <p>The Rule for Suſpenſion is in <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.4, 5. <hi>from the Prieſts ſhutting up the Leper ſeven days</hi>— And <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Leave thy gift before the Altar</hi>— And <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. The Church muſt be told of his ſin, and of his obſtinacy under the former ſteps of proceeding
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:96313:194"/>
with him, and it muſt appear that he doth not hear the Church before he may be made an Heathen and a Publican.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how long muſt they delay the ſentence of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There cannot be a particular time limited, becauſe of the infinite variety of particular Caſes &amp; Circumſtances: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whether an Offender ſhould lie under ſuſpenſion a week, or a month, or a longer, or ſhorter time, God hath left it to Chriſtian wiſdom.</p>
               <p>It is dangerous to limit and make particular Rules, when God hath made none.</p>
               <p>The general Rule, which is ſufficient to guide and give light in all particular caſes, is this. That till it do appear that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender ſins preſumptuouſly, the Church ſhould not proceed to Excommunication.</p>
               <p>If the Caſe be dubious and uncertain, whether he be a leprous, a preſumptuous ſinner or no, as <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. <hi>then ſhut him up ſeven days more,</hi> till it do appear that he is a Leper, and a Preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinner.</p>
               <p>The ſame Rule is given concerning leſſer &amp; private offences, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. <hi>If thy Brother offend thee, tell him between him and thee: If he will not hear thee, take with thee one or two more: And if he ſhall neglect to hear them, then tell it to the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tell it. What is meant by the word <hi>[it?]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt needs relate to the private offenſe before mentioned.</p>
               <p>This Text therefore ſpeaks not of publick Scandals; but of ſuch Offenſes as are private, till the Offenders impenitency neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate the making of them publick.</p>
               <p>The ſame Rule is given in caſe of corrupt Opinions. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.10. There muſt be a firſt and a ſecond Admonition before Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. The Reaſon is becauſe it may be hoped in theſe Caſes, that the mans ſin may have been for want of Conviction, and therefore not of Preſumption; unleſs he reſiſt light, when means and matter of Conviction is held forth. And in private Offences the matter may poſſibly be healed privately.</p>
               <p>Rule 2. <hi>In other caſes there is no need of ſuch delatory proceeding.</hi>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:96313:194"/>
If it be evident and apparent, that the Sinner doth not ſin for want of Light, but preſumptuouſly againſt Light.</p>
               <p>And if the thing be already publick, ſo that it cannot be hid nor healed privately, as in the caſe of publick ſcandals. When the Offenſe is ſo hainous, that it cryes to heaven for vengeance, waſteth the Conſcience, and is generally ſcandalous; the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Church may proceed with more expedition.<note place="margin">See <hi>Scobels</hi> Collect of Acts and Ordinance, an. <hi>48.</hi> cap. <hi>118.</hi> pag. <hi>119.</hi>
                  </note> Thus ordained that great <hi>reforming Parliament</hi> by the advice of that <hi>Aſſemby of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> that ſate at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> upon their Call.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons to prove this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with Offenders, ought to be more ſpeedy and ſummary in Caſes of atrocious wickedneſs, are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From <hi>Lev.</hi> 13. The Prieſt is directed to ſuſpend or ſhut him up ſeven days, if the Caſe be doubtful.</p>
               <p>But if it be evident that the man is a Leper, (and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinners may well be accounted Lepers) the Rule is to ſhut him out of the Camp, not to ſuſpend him ſeven days, but ſhut him out immediatly. See <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, and 46.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. From the Caſe of the Inceſtuous perſon in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. The Apoſtle doth not warn them to take heed of Excommunicating him, and to ſuſpend him firſt, and then to wait meekly and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for him, till he repent. No, but he declares he had already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the Caſe, that he ſhould be delivered to Satan, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4.</p>
               <p>And indeed there is a general ſilence throughout the Scripture, concerning ſuch gradations and delays in caſe of publick flagrant ſcandals. There is no Caution, no direction given for ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Admonitions to be given to ſuch perſons, in order to the preventing of Excommunication.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. From the ſtrange impenitency and hardneſs of heart that is in ſcandalous ſinners.</p>
               <p>To inſtance in the ſin of Uncleanneſs, which is the Caſe that now lyes before us, it is a very blinding hardning ſin. <hi>Prov</hi> 9.18. <hi>But he knows not that the dead are there: and that her Gueſts are in the depths of Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the fruit of a ſeared Conſcience, a Conſcience paſt feeling.
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:96313:195"/>
Epheſ. 4.19. <hi>Who being paſt feeling, have given themſelves over unto laſciviouſneſs to work uncleanneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This meets with that Objection: ſhould the Church cenſure a repenting ſinner?</p>
               <p>I will not now diſpute that queſtion, whether Repentance be always enough to prevent Church Cenſures.</p>
               <p>Some think it is not: for doubtleſs <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.11, 12. See how <hi>Aaron</hi> there confeſſeth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wails the ſin; and he ſpeaks in the plural Number for them both.</p>
               <p>But here was a very ſcandalous ſin, inſolent and ſeditious ſpeeches againſt the chief Magiſtrate and Prophet of God, who was exceeding faithful in his place, for which God ſmites her with Leproſie; and notwithſtanding their own confeſſions, and <hi>Moſes</hi> his Interceſſions for them, the Lord would have her ſhut out. Verſ. 14. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>if her Father had ſpit in her face; ſhould ſhe not be aſhamed ſeven days? Let her be ſhut out from the Camp ſeven days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So we may ſay of Fornicators, or of any other flagitious ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: if his Father had but ſpit in his face, ſhould he not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſeven days? And ſhall he not be ſhut out of the Church at all for Fornication?</p>
               <p>But there is no need to debate that: for all ſcandalous ſinners are impenitent perſons, and are ſo to be accounted by all that fear God, till full proof and evidence do appear, that they have forſaken thoſe ſcandalous and wicked ways. And this neither doth, nor can appear ordinarily, till after there hath been a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſpace and time, and tryal and experience how they walk.</p>
               <p>Confeſſion of a publick Scandal when the Evidence of the Fact is undeniable, is no ſufficient Evidence of repentance: for <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> did this.</p>
               <p>And no man that hath the uſe of his Reaſon, can or will do otherwiſe: for to what purpoſe is it to deny that which all men know? Or to ſeek to conceal that which cannot be hid?</p>
               <p>In the Confeſſions of ſuch perſons it is obſerveable, That they are either meerely forced and extorted by the hand of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> was when he confeſſed <hi>the Lord is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:96313:195"/>
but I and my people are wicked:</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> his, by the horror of his Conſcience, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.3, 4, 5. Or elſe their Confeſſion is extorted by the undeniable Evidence of the Fact, and mingled with manifeſt diſcoveries of Pride, even when they ſeem to be taking ſhame to themſelves; as <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. Or, (which is worſt of all,) their Confeſſions are mingled ſometimes with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives againſt thoſe which reprove them. As <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6. <hi>They turn again and rent you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Inſtead of an humble broken hearted Confeſſion, you ſhall ſometimes have a venomous virulent Confeſſion from them, wherein their Confeſſions againſt themſelves are mingled with ſlanderous reflections and invectives againſt their Reprovers. Yet when Excommunication is moſt ſpeedy, it ſhould not be without admonition, both before, and in the Ordinance, and after. But ſhut out they muſt be.</p>
               <p>Hence continual ſuſpenſion is an abuſe; for ſcandalous ſinners to ſtand ſuſpended from year to year, but never fully caſt out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 5. To whom doth the power of Excommunication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This hath been matter of much controverſy; there have been ſeveral claims ſet on foot, and many pretenders to this power. The <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> have been ſufficiently detected to be meer Thieves, and Robbers, and Uſurpers upon the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the Lord.</p>
               <p>All the Queſtion that remains, is about the power of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and the People. But I ſhall wave that which is controverſal among the godly learned.</p>
               <p>I would endeavour ſo to ſtate the Caſe as to prevent and cut off Diſputes and Janglings. Therefore note only thus much: That it is a general Rule in all Church Adminiſtrations, that the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are to guide, and go before the Flock, and the People are to obey them in the Lord. Hence they are called <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Obey them that have the Rule over you.</hi> Heb. 13. See Rev. 4. <hi>When the four living Wights,</hi> that is the Elders of the Church, <hi>give glory to God, then the four and twenty Elders,</hi> that is, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church <hi>fall down before him and worſhip him.</hi>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:96313:196"/>
So in this buſineſs of Excommunication, both the Elders and People have ſomething to do in it. To ſpeak to them ſeverally.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Duty of the Elders or Miniſters: This lies in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the Miniſters part to enquire of the Lord for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to declare the mind of God unto them, what the Lord would have them to do. It is the Miniſters duty to enquire of the Lord for them. <hi>They muſt</hi> Deut. 17.9, 10, 11. <hi>come to the Prieſt for judgment:</hi> So <hi>Abiathar</hi> inquires of the Lord for <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is their part alſo to declare the Anſwer of God to his People. To hold forth the mind of God, and their duty to them. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.9. <hi>They ſhall ſhew thee the ſentence of Judgment.</hi> There is the like Rule for Goſpel times. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.23, 24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To pronounce the Leper unclean: To make him unclean, that is authoritatively to declare him ſo. This belongs to the Elders of the Church. <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.3. Some body muſt do it, and who fitter than the Officers, who have the Government of the Church in their hands? Whoſe ſins ye retain, they are retained. <hi>Whoſe ſins ye retain,</hi> that is, in a Miniſterial way, in Chriſts name, <hi>they are retained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when the Miniſter hath done his part; what is the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples part in this work?</p>
               <p>As I ſaid before: I ſhall not wade into controverſies.</p>
               <p>There be two things which are clear. There is a double act of obedience on the peoples part.</p>

               <p>The Reaſon hereof is plain.</p>
               <p>Either the people muſt thus concur, or elſe diſſent, or elſe ſtand by as idle Spectators, and perſons unconcerned: but they may not diſſent: for remember how the Caſe was ſtated concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Officers that are faithful in the diſcharge of their truſt. In ſuch a Caſe for the people to diſſent, is, not ſo much to diſobey them, as to diſobey the Lord Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They have not rejected thee, but me.</hi> 1 Sam. 8.7.</p>
               <p>Neither are the people to ſtand by as Newters, and perſons meerly unconcerned: for this were to fruſtrate the ſentence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and to make it void, for the ſentence doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him from the fellowſhip of Gods people: and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they make Conſcience of it, to forbear keeping company with him, the ſentence is vain. It remains therefore that there is, and ought to be a concurrence of the people in Church Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> But all this that hath been ſaid, goes upon this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; that the Officers are faithful in the diſcharge and executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Office.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe the Officers be unfaithful, and will not exclude ignorant and profane people, or will receive them, and ſhut out better then they.</p>
               <p>Or ſuppoſe the people be froward, and will not withdraw from the looſer ſort, or will not conſent to have them caſt out; what is to be done in ſuch a Caſe? What is the Remedy there?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a Caſe that ſeldom or never falls out in reformed Churches, in Churches rightly conſtituted, and Officers rightly qualified, it cannot often fall out: becauſe the Lord hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his preſence to be in the midſt of them; and therefore he will manifeſt and make known his mind, and their duty to them.</p>

                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:96313:197"/>The laſt Remedy that Miniſters have, is, to reform the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Church, by withdrawing from ſuch a corrupt Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as will not be perſwaded to obey them in the Lord, and to cloſe with the leſſer, but ſounder part of the people. And this is the Remedy that all the Godly Miniſters generally have taken: they have left out the ignorant and profane part of the Pariſh from the Sacraments, eſpecially from the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>So in like manner, if Miniſters be ſo large in their Principles, that they will needs pollute the Ordinances; what can the people do in ſuch a Caſe to help themſelves: but, after all other means uſed, to betake themſelves to ſome better Miniſter and purer Church? This is the laſt Remedy in ſuch a Caſe: and ſo I have done with the fourth Obſervation concerning the Lepers duty, or puniſhment. Beſide other things, <hi>he muſt dwell alone, and be ſhut out.</hi>

The aſhes of an Heyſer ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the unclean.</hi> The Law for it is in the 19. Chapter of <hi>Numbers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be two things chiefly to be conſidered in it, as in other Sacrifices.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The matter of it.</item>
                  <item>2. The Ceremonies, or actions about it for Purification.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The Matter; and under this there be four things obſervable.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That it was an Heyſer.</item>
                  <item>2. A Red Heyſer.</item>
                  <item>3. Without ſpot or blemiſh.</item>
                  <item>4. On which never came Yoak.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. It muſt be an <hi>Heyſer:</hi> So in the Text, ſo in <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>The Lord ſpake unto</hi> Moſes <hi>and unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>ſaying, this is the Ordinance of the Law which the Lord hath commanded, ſaying,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:96313:198"/>
ſpeak unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that they may bring thee a red Heiſer without ſpot, wherein is no blemiſh, and upon which never Yoke came.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is Gods Authority, ſo appointing that it ſhould be an Heifer, though ordinarily they were to offer Males; yet here the Law you ſee, is expreſly otherwiſe; it muſt not be a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, but an Heifer: therefore this was a peculiar kind of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. God by his ſovereign Authority did, and might appoint what he pleaſed to be offered in his Sacrifices.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is particularly required, that it be a <hi>red Heifer:</hi> a colour often and fitly applied to Chriſt in a myſtical ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Beloved is white and ruddy. Cant.</hi> 5.10. ſo <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.1. <hi>Who is this that cometh from</hi> Edom, <hi>with red Garments from</hi> Bozrah? Red with his own blood, and with the blood of his conquered Enemies. And <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.13. <hi>his Veſture dipt in blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The redneſs of the Heifer did alſo point at the humane nature of Chriſt, which he had from <hi>Adam, who was made out of red Earth.</hi> Gen. 2.7. from which alſo he took his name <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Chriſt is red, and that in regard of his ſufferings, and in regard of his victories, and of the blood of his conquered Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and alſo in regard of his beauty; and laſtly, in regard that he took part of fleſh and blood, was really and truly man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is further required in this Sacrifice, that it muſt be <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot and blemiſh.</hi> Numb. 19.2.</p>
               <p>This was required in all the Sacrifices, as <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.3, 10. <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh.</hi> And it ſpeaks forth the purity and perfection of Jeſus Chriſt: therefore it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>We are redeemed by his blood, as of a Lamb without ſpot and blemiſh.</hi> And <hi>him that knew no ſin, hath God made ſin for us, that we might become the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God by him.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. So he is both white and rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy— Ruddy in regard of his bloody Sufferings: but white in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his pure and perfect Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It muſt be ſuch an Heifer, on which <hi>never came Yoke.</hi> Numb. 19.2. So Chriſt was free from the bondage of ſin, and did never come under the yoke of mens Inventions and Commands: nor did he ſuffer by compulſion, but freely and willingly when he died for us,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:96313:199"/>Sin, and the puniſhment of it, is compared in Scripture to a Yoke. <hi>Lament.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Yoke of my Tranſgreſſions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck.</hi> And ſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.33, 34, 35, 36.</p>
               <p>He that lives in ſin, and commits and makes a Trade of it, he is the ſervant of ſin.</p>
               <p>They boaſted that they were free, and never in bondage to any man; but he tells them of a ſpiritual ſervitude, which they underſtood not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This was Chriſt free from</p>
               <p>And yet further, as there was not this Yoke of ſin upon him: ſo neither was there any Yoke of conſtraint or compulſion in his Sufferings, in any thing he underwent for us: all he did and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, was ſpontaneous and voluntary. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.17, 18. <hi>I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</hi> So here is a Heifer, a red Heifer, a Heifer without ſpot, and one upon which never came Yoke.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the Actions and Ceremonies about the Heifer, which were alſo very ſignificant, and full of ſpiritual myſtery. Not to inſiſt upon the bringing of her to the Prieſt, which was common to all the Sacrifices, there were four eſpecially remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That ſhe muſt be ſlain without the Camp.</item>
                  <item>2. The blood ſprinkled ſeven times towards the Tabernacle.</item>
                  <item>3. The body burnt with Cedar, Scarlet, and Hyſlop, call in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to the fire.</item>
                  <item>4. The Aſhes reſerved to make an holy Water to ſprinkle the unclean.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. This Heifer muſt be <hi>ſlain without the Camp</hi> This is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Numb</hi> 19.3. This Ceremony was required alſo in the Sin-Offering. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4 12.</p>
               <p>This is expounded at large by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>We have an Altar whereof they have no right to eat, which ſerve the Tabernacle. For the bodies of thoſe Beaſts, whoſe blood is brought into the Sanctuary by the High Prieſt for ſin, are burnt without the Camp. Wherefore Jeſus alſo that he might ſanctify
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:96313:199"/>
the people with his own blood, ſuffered without the Gate. Let us go forth therefore unto him without the Camp, bearing his reproach. For here have we no continuing City, but we ſeek one to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some Sacrifices were to be eaten; but other Sacrifices, the Sin Offering, and this of the Heyfer for Purifications, they were not to eat them, but to kill them, and burn them out of the Camp. This ſhews that they which ſerve the Temple, which adhere to old legal carnal ways, they have no right to eat of the Altar, ſaith the Apoſtle; they that ſerve the Tabernacle, that adhere to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to thoſe things that are of mens wiſdom and invention (as all <hi>Moſes</hi> his Ceremonies now are, being abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by God. And therefore now to adhere to them, and to ſerve the Tabernacle, is to follow our own wiſdom, and worſhip God according to our own pleaſure) ſuch have no right to eat of the Altar; they have no right to Jeſus Chriſt, in that they keep not to the purity of his own Inſtitutions.</p>
               <p>Again, Jeſus Chriſt did ſuffer without the Gate, which was prefigured by this their carrying this Heyfer out, there to be ſlain.</p>
               <p>So they carried Jeſus Chriſt out to <hi>Golgotha,</hi> there they Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him, ſo that it was fulfilled in Chriſt in a very manifeſt way. For that he ſuffered without the City, as this Heyfer was to be ſlain without the Camp.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt therefore being a reputed Sinner and Malefactor, and under that reproach and ſhame did therefore ſuffer without the Gate. We muſt therefore be content to ſuffer with him in the ſame diſgrace and diſhonor. If ye cannot be content to bear the reproaches and diſgraces of the world, ye cannot bear his reproach.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles were accounted the very filth of the World, ſuch as by ſweeping is gathered together (as in the Margent) the ſwepings and refuſe of all things. <hi>Wo unto you when all men ſhall ſpeak well of you</hi> Luk. 6 26. We ſee the myſtery then of this Ceremony, that the Heyfer muſt be ſlain without the Camp.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Blood muſt be ſprinkled ſeven times directly towards the Tabernacle. For the Prieſt is ſpoken of as ſtanding without
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:96313:200"/>
the Camp where the Heyfer was ſlain, who was to ſprinkle the blood towards the Camp, and ſo towards the Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>The Tabernacle was a Type of Heaven; therefore the ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Blood towards Heaven, taught us, That our acceſs into Heaven is only by the perfect merit of the blood of Chriſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20.</p>
               <p>The ſprinkling ſeven times notes the perfect efficacy of the blood of Chriſt; for ſeven is a number of perfection; therefore often uſed in thoſe myſtical Diſpenſations of old. It ſhews the perfection of his blood, and that there muſt be frequent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed application of it from time to time; It muſt be ſprinkled again and again, and ſeven times over upon our Conſciences.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The body of the Heyfer muſt be burnt with Cedar, Hyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop and Scarlet, caſt into the fire, and the Prieſts that do it are unclean until the Even <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Of the Burning you have heard upon other Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>The caſting in of Cedar, Hyſſop and Scarlet, is peculiar to this Sacrifice; and ſomething of Inſtruction we may pick out of it by looking into other Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Cedar is noted for an excellent kind of Timber, the chief of Trees; and the Scripture doth ſometimes apply it unto Chriſt in a Metaphorical way. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.15. It is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is as</hi> Lebanon, <hi>excellent as the Cedars.</hi> It is a ſtately and durable Tree, not ſubject to putrefaction. Therefore ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this Law as a ſhadow of the perpetual efficacy of the death of Chriſt, <hi>who by one offering perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> Heb. 10.14.</p>
               <p>As for Hyſſop, it is ſaid <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. there muſt be a bunch of it to ſprinkle with. Hence <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>Purge me with Hyſſop.</hi> Pſal. 51.7. Some apply it thus: That the Bunch of Hyſſop wherein they ſprinkled the blood, is the Word of Promiſe, by which Chriſt is applied to the Soul.</p>
               <p>Or thus. The Bunch of Hyſſop ſignifies the Inſtrument of the application of Chriſts blood. And what is the Inſtrument by which we apply the blood of Chriſt, but Faith, and this Faith lays hold on the promiſe. It is the word of promiſe that brings
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:96313:200"/>
Chriſt and his blood unto the Soul, and the Soul receives it by Faith. This muſt be caſt into the burning.</p>
               <p>It is by the death and ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, that the promiſes are made effectual, and that they have the virtue of cleanſing us from our ſins. And they were alſo to caſt Scarlet into the burning.</p>
               <p>Scarlet is of a red colour, and we read in Scripture of Scarlet ſins. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Though your ſins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be made as Snow.</hi> The death and blood of Jeſus Chriſt ſaith the Apoſtle, cleanſeth us from all ſin. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7.</p>
               <p>And further, he that doth all this, muſt yet be unclean until the Evening: ſo before in the Sin-Offering, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4. with <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.27, 28. which plainly holds forth the imperfection of all Legal Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and the Iniquity that cleaves to our holy Offerings, as was there ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth thing is, the aſhes muſt be gathered and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make an holy Water of, to ſprinkle the unclean. <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.9— 17, 18.</p>
               <p>This Water which was made by means of this ſacred Relick, is called in another place of Scripture, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.17. <hi>holy Water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is called <hi>holy,</hi> becauſe it was appointed by God for a holy uſe. He can ſet his Stamp upon, and hallow this Water, as he did on the Bread and Wine, appointing it for a holy uſe: and ſo this, it muſt be kept for an holy uſe, and every unclean perſon muſt be ſprinkled with it.</p>
               <p>Now the meaning of this ſanctifying to the purifying of the fleſh, is this, it plainly ſignifies the ſprinkling of the blood and ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt upon us, for Juſtification and Sanctification. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.8. <hi>There are three that bear witneſs in the Earth, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the Water and the Blood, and theſe three agree in one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is the Spirit of Faith in Vocation.</p>
               <p>The Water of Sanctification.</p>
               <p>And the blood of Jeſus Chriſt for Juſtification.</p>
               <p>Theſe three concur in their Evidence and Teſtimony, that there is virtue and life in Chriſt for them that believe: ſo you ſee the myſtery of it. When perſons were ſprinkled with this Water, they became clean; others might converſe with them,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:96313:201"/>
they might come into the Tabernacle, and have Communion with God in his Ordinances.</p>
               <p>This holds forth Souls being ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt, and with the Spirit, which is often compared to Water, as when it is ſaid, <hi>I will pour water on the dry ground, and my Spirit on your Off ſpring.</hi> Iſai. 44.3. ſee alſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. and <hi>Joh</hi> 7.38, 39.</p>
               <p>So they that have this ſprinkling by the blood of Chriſt, they have acceſs to, and fellowſhip with God by the blood of Chriſt. And ſo much for the meaning of the Ceremonial actions relating to this Heyfer.</p>
               <p>Now for Uſe and Application a little, and ſo we ſhall conclude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Learn this Inſtruction: See the Sovereign vertue &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent excellency of the blood of Chriſt; and it gives directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and incouragement to unclean ſouls to have recourſe to Jeſus Chriſt for cleanſing. If theſe things did ſo avail to the purifying of the fleſh, <hi>how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt cleanſe your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from dead works to ſerve the living God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The vertue and excellency of his blood appears, as to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of our Souls and Conſciences in a fourfold reſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If compared with Ceremonial blood, of which the Text ſpeaks. The Sacrifices were but ſhadowy cleanſings, but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy purification: But the blood of Chriſt cleanſing the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is the thing aimed at. Theſe were the means to ſhadow out this ſpiritual cleanſing. This is the end, the ſubſtance aimed at.</p>
               <p>They gave an outward holineſs, no inward holineſs. When they were made Ceremonially clean, they did not change the mind, they removed but the ſhadow of Moral uncleanneſs, for Ceremonial uncleanneſs was no ſin, but only a ſhadow of it: But the blood of Chriſt removes the ſin it ſelf; the guilt of ſin in Juſtification, and the power of ſin in Sanctification. So the blood of Chriſt hath a ſurpaſſing excellency, being compared with the blood of Bulls and Goats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Compare it to the blood of Souls and Sinners.</p>
               <p>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt brings more glory to God, than if all the Elect themſelves had ſuffered to all eternity, more glory
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:96313:201"/>
to God: And it is more efficacious for the good of Souls.</p>
               <p>If the Elect had ſuffered, and their blood had been ſhed for their own ſins, God had wanted much of that glory, which he hath by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt. And more efficacious for good to them: For they could never have been ſaved by their own ſufferings.</p>
               <p>The worth of the blood of Chriſt appears
<list>
                     <item>1. In regard of the worth of the Perſon.</item>
                     <item>2. In regard of the ſpeedy ſatisfaction.</item>
                     <item>3. In regard of the full ſatisfaction.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The worth of the Perſon: This is often taken notice of in Scripture, as belonging to the efficacy of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, that it is <hi>the blood of God:</hi> As <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. and <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.7. He is the Man that is <hi>the fellow of the Lord of Hoſts:</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle having ſpoken in <hi>Coll.</hi> 1. <hi>how that we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveneſs of ſin.</hi> In verſ. 14. he falls into a deſcription of the glory of the perſon of Chriſt. <hi>Who is the Image of the inviſible God, by him were all things made.</hi> The dignity of his Perſon puts an infinite value on his blood and ſufferings, mounting the blood of Chriſt to a higher ſatisfaction of Divine Juſtice, than the blood of all the Elect.</p>
               <p>The Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, is a more glorious Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs than if all the Elect had ſuffered for themſelves; that had been but the blood of Sinners, this the blood of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpeedy ſatisfaction that is made to Divine Juſtice. Chriſt paid all the Debt at once, which Sinners muſt have been paying for ever: And this is more ſatisfactory to the Creditor, than to have the Debt long a paying.</p>
               <p>If a man owe an hundred pounds, and muſt lie in Priſon till the Debt be paid, paying ten pounds every year; this Debt will be long in paying, and it will not be ſo ſatisfactory to the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as if a Rich Man ſhould come and ſet the Priſoner free by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Debt preſently.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſatisfied fully, and paid the whole Debt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.30. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Now it is finiſhed.</hi> He hath made full and perfect ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice. So that the Law of God
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:96313:202"/>
hath more honor, and the Juſtice of God more glory, by the ſufferings of Chriſt, than if all the Elect had ſuffered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Compare the blood of Chriſt with the Righteouſneſs of Saints and Angels, his Righteouſneſs, and their Righteouſneſs. There is a greater Glory of Jeſus Chriſt, his obedience Active and Paſſive; then in the Righteouſneſs of all the Angels in Heaven, though they had never ſinned. For theirs is but the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Creatures, in whom is a negative imperfection. <hi>Job.</hi> 4.18. <hi>He chargeth the Angels with folly, and the Heavens are impure in his ſight.</hi> Chriſts Righteouſneſs is more worth, then all the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs of all the Creatures.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If compared with the power of ſin in its kind, to defile and damn ſouls; there is a far greater power in the blood of Chriſt to cleanſe and ſave, then in ſin to defile and deſtroy. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. The Law became weak to do good, but it hath power to condemn. <hi>The ſtrength of ſin is the Law.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.56.</p>
               <p>The Law gives a ſtrength to ſin, becauſe by virtue of the curſe of the Law, ſin reigns and defiles the ſouls of men through that righteous Curſe. <hi>The Soul that ſins ſhall dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the blood of Jeſus Chriſt hath greater power to ſave, then ſin (together with the Law) hath to condemn: for the blood of Chriſt takes away and aboliſhes it utterly. Where this blood is applied and brought home, ſin it ſelf cannot ruine that Soul. The Soul is poyſoned and corrupted by ſin; but the blood of Chriſt takes away that poyſon, and makes the Soul pure and holy, as if it never had ſinned: therefore as to thoſe diſcouragements, I ſhall never get power againſt theſe ſins, againſt theſe Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they will be my ruine. Theſe are deep reflectings on Jeſus Chriſt, as if ſin were ſtronger then he, as if thy ſin were more powerful to damn thee, then Chriſt is to ſave thee.</p>
               <p>Therefore be encouraged, how unclean ſoever thy heart and life have been, make uſe of this Atonement which hath been made to God by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>What is the preaching of the Goſpel, but the ſprinkling of this blood? It holds forth Chriſt, and if men will refuſe this blood, their deſtruction is of themſelves; they periſh not under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:96313:202"/>
becauſe there is no means of Salvation, no means to help, no means to cleanſe and purifie them; but becauſe they will not make uſe of it.</p>
               <p>And what a woful thing is this, when light is come into the world, and help brought by Jeſus Chriſt, for ſinners to refuſe it. For ſinners to ſtand on their own Objections, this is to bid defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Goſpel, and to ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt is no ſufficient Saviour. But apply it, and make uſe of it, and it will cleanſe thy Soul for ever.</p>

               <p>THe Apoſtle in theſe expreſſions, <hi>[the blood of Bulls and Goats]</hi> includes, by a parity of reaſon, all the other Ceremonial Cleanſings which are not particularly mentioned.</p>
               <p>As they had three ſorts of Ceremonial Uncleanneſs; ſo they had three ways of Purification.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the uncleanneſs by touching any unclean Meat or thing.</p>
               <p>The purification for this was by the Red Heyfer, which the Holy Ghoſt mentions in the Text particularly, whereof we ſpake the laſt time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For unclean Iſſues: Two Turtle Doves or two young Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the one for a Sin Offering, the other for a Burnt Offering. <hi>Lev.</hi> 15.14, 15. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 12.8. Or a Lamb and a young Pigeon, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. The rites whereof being the ſame with the Burnt-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the Sin-Offering, were there handled, and ſo need not be ſpoken to here again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third ſort of Ceremonial uncleanneſs, was that unclean diſeaſe of Leproſie, which is treated of at large in <hi>Lev.</hi> 13. and the Cleanſing of it in Chap. 14.</p>
               <p>Of the Diſeaſe we have formerly ſpoken in the expoſition of the 13. Chapter, and ſhall therefore now proceed to the cleanſing of it; which was done by ſeveral Sacrifices and Ceremonies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and directed in that 14. Chapter of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> wherein the method the Holy Ghoſt is pleaſed to uſe is this. He gives direction firſt concerning the cleanſing of a Leprous perſon to
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:96313:203"/>
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 33. and then of a Leprous houſe, from <hi>ver.</hi> 33. to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Rules and Directions about the cleanſing of a leprous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are of two ſorts: Preparative and Executive.</p>
               <p>The preparatory directions are theſe three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He muſt be brought unto the Prieſt.</hi> Lev. 14. ver. 2.</p>
               <p>This was an Ordinance of God, and therefore Chriſt himſelf requires the obſervation of it; of that Leper whom he himſelf had cured miraculouſly. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Go ſhew thy ſelf unto the Prieſt, and offer the Gift that</hi> Moſes <hi>commanded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Leper was to dwell alone without the Camp, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City; but he was to be brought to the outmoſt part of the Camp, or to the Gates of the City, to the Prieſt.</p>
               <p>Now the true Prieſt is Jeſus Chriſt: Therefore the meaning of this Ordinance was plainly and clearly this.</p>
               <p>That Leprous ſouls muſt come to Jeſus Chriſt by Faith for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual healing. <hi>He is ſaid to ariſe with healing in his wings.</hi> Mal. 4.2.</p>
               <p>You know how many Lepers he did heal in the days of his fleſh. And all the Miracles of Chriſt had a ſymbolical uſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us in what he does for Souls in a ſpiritual way, by what he did for mens bodies in a miraculous way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Prieſt muſt go forth out of the Camp to the Leper.</hi> ver. 3.</p>
               <p>This plainly ſpeaks thus much: That Jeſus Chriſt goes forth unto poor ſinners when in their diſtance, in their back ſlidings and ſeparations from the Lord: he ſeeks them and finds them out, whoſe bleſſed Office it is, <hi>to ſeek and to ſave loſt ſinners.</hi> Luk. 19.10.</p>
               <p>We are by nature far from God, ſhut out and caſt forth <hi>aliens from the Common-wealth of</hi> Iſrael. Epheſ. 1.12. <hi>When thou waſt in thy blood, I paſſed by and pittied thee.</hi> Ezek. 16.6. He goes to meet the returning Prodigal. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.20. As the Prieſt here to meet the Leper, when ſhut out of the Camp of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Prieſt ſhall ſee and behold if the plague of Leproſie be healed in the Leper. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. The Judgment of it is committed to the Prieſt, and he muſt judge as the thing is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="397" facs="tcp:96313:203"/>It is Chriſt himſelf that is the Judge of Souls, and he will judge true and righteous Judgment, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.3. he ſhall not judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeeing of his eyes.</p>
               <p>Though men judge thou art a Leper, a Schiſmatick, a Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, be not troubled, if the Prieſt pronounce thee clean, if the Lord hath ſaid it to thee by the witneſs of his Spirit in his Word.</p>
               <p>It is the Prieſt muſt judge, and it is this Word which cannot err nor lye, that ſhall judge of thee at that day.</p>
               <p>It belongs alſo to Miniſters in an inferior way to judge of men, to diſcern between the Clean and the Unclean, and to retain or remit ſins Miniſterially. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.23. Theſe are the preparatory directions for the purification of the Leper.</p>
               <p>Now, 2. The Executive part follows from <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. &amp;c. and it conſiſts mainly in two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Sacrifice of two Birds and their Ceremonies, to <hi>verſ.</hi> 10.</item>
                  <item>2. A Sacrifice of three Lambs with their Appurtenances and Ceremonies, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, to 21.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt part of the Purification of the Leper, is by two Birds and the Ceremonies belonging to them, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, to <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. The Materials here required are <hi>two living clean Birds, together with Cedar Scarlet and Hyſſop,</hi> verſ. 4.</p>
               <p>The Birds are thought to be <hi>Sparrows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Hebrew word <hi>Ziphor</hi> ſignifies a Bird in general, any wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fowl. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.17. <hi>They are forbidden to make the likeneſs of any winged Fowl that flyeth in the Air.</hi> Pſal. 8.8. <hi>The Fowls of the Air.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is ſometimes uſed particularly concerning a <hi>Sparrow, Pſal.</hi> 84.3. and 102.7.</p>
               <p>We may underſtand it here in the largeſt ſenſe for any clean Birds. Theſe two Birds and the Herbs, are the Ingredients that muſt all concur to make up the matter of this cleanſing Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>The two Birds were not two Sacrifices: for one of them was not ſlain, but diſmiſſed: but they did both make up one Sacrifice, ſome of the Myſteries whereof, could not be repreſented by one Bird: and therefore two were appointed, the one to dye, and the other to live.</p>
               <p>They had another Ordinance of the like nature, and of the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:96313:204"/>
ſame importance with this, <hi>viz.</hi> the two Goats on the yearly Feaſt of Expiation, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. whereof the one was ſlain, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did eſcape, being ſent away into the Wilderneſs: therefore called the Seape-Goat.</p>
               <p>But why were there two Birds, and what was the Myſtery of this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It ſhadowed forth both the natures and eſtates of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Both his natures; his eternal Deity and his mortal Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are here prefigured and repreſented.</p>
               <p>The ſlain Bird, repreſents his humane nature capable of death and ſuffering.</p>
               <p>The other Bird his divine nature, which was and is immortal and impaſſible.</p>
               <p>As both theſe Birds were neceſſary, and muſt be uſed in this Sacrifice: ſo Chriſt our Sacrifice muſt be both God and man. We are not cleanſed and ſaved either by his Deity or Humanity alone: but both his natures do concur in his mediatorial Actions for our Salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is a ſhadow of the twofold ſtate that Jeſus Chriſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thorough: firſt a ſtate of death and humiliation, and then a ſtate of life and glory. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for ſins, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the fleſh, but quickened by the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Put to death in the fleſh,</hi> that is, in his humane nature; <hi>but quickened by the Spirit,</hi> that is, by his Deity raiſing him up again from death to life; he muſt both dye and live again for us.</p>
               <p>As to the Cedar Hyſſop and Scarlet, they were uſed in the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification by the Red Heifer, of which we ſpoke before, and ſhall now add thereunto only thus much further.</p>
               <p>That of theſe three, it is conceived, that there was a ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Bruſh made, namely the Bruſh of Hyſſop, the Handle of Cedar Wood, and the binding of a thred of Scarlet dy.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle calls it Scarlet Wooll in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19. And as there ſeems to be a general reſpect had to the properties of theſe Plants, as was formerly ſhewed: ſo ſome do obſerve a particular ſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:96313:204"/>
between the Leprous Contagion, and theſe means of Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, thus.</p>
               <p>That as the Leproſie did corrupt and putrifie the body; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to this was the Cedar-Wood, which is commended for firmneſs and ſoundneſs againſt putrefaction.</p>
               <p>And as the Leproſie was of a foul colour: contrary to this was the freſh and fair colour of Scarlet.</p>
               <p>And as the Leproſie had a very ill and unſavoury ſcent: the ſweetneſs of Hyſſop was a Remedy againſt that. So our Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors on <hi>Lev.</hi> 14.6.</p>
               <p>Thus for the Materials of this purifying Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Now the purifying Ceremonies and Actions were of three ſorts, and all full of myſtery: ſome relating to the ſlain Bird, ſome to the living Bird, and ſome to the Leper himſelf.</p>
               <p>Let me briefly open them unto you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Ceremonies of the ſlain Bird, were chiefly theſe three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It muſt be killed,</hi> verſ. 5. You know the myſtery of this in all the Sacrifices; it was a prefiguration of the death of Jeſus Chriſt the true Sacrifice. <hi>Almoſt all things in the Law were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by blood, and without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion.</hi> Heb. 9.22.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It muſt be killed over running Water, or living Water.</hi> That is, Spring Water called Living, becauſe of the continual motion reſembling life thereby; that is, it muſt be taken out of a Spring or a River, not out of a Pond, or Rain Water.</p>
               <p>What this means, our Saviour himſelf interprets <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10, 14. where he ſpeaks of <hi>ſpiritual Living Water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the blood thus falling into, and being mingled with the Water; points us clearly to him, <hi>who came to cleanſe us and ſave us by water and blood.</hi> 1 Joh. 5.6. For as water and blood here meet: ſo there were Streams of both iſſuing out of his Side, when he was ſlain for us. <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>But this water and blood, is the blood of Juſtification, and the water of Sanctification, both plentifully flowing from Chriſt our Purification.</p>
               <p>There is an ever flowing Fountain of theſe Waters of life in and
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:96313:205"/>
from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the cleanſing of ſinful and leprous Souls.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This muſt be in an earthen Veſſel.</hi> The like, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.17. The ſenſe of this part of the Allegory, may be eaſily gathered from the former. That Soul-cleanſing blood and water iſſued out of his bleſſed body: therefore his body was this earthen Veſſel, which was frail and brittle, and accordingly broken by death at laſt; and mean and contemptible amongſt men, as earthen Veſſels uſe to be.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters of the Goſpel alſo are compared to earthen Veſſels, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. God uſeth contemptible Inſtruments many times, for the effecting of great things.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Ceremonies relating to the ſlain Bird; it muſt be killed, and it muſt be killed over Living Water, and this is in an earthen Veſſel.</p>
               <p>Now, 2. The Ceremonies belonging to the living Bird, they are alſo three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The living Bird muſt be dipt in the blood of the ſlain Bird,</hi> verſ. 6. A moſt evident and excellent repreſentation of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the divine and humane nature of Jeſus Chriſt, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of that union into the concernments of our peace. Had not the Deity ſupported and influenced the humane nature in its ſufferings, they could not have been available with God for us.</p>
               <p>Upon the account of this divine union and dipping of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Bird in the blood of the ſlain, the Apoſtle calls the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the humane nature, <hi>the blood of God.</hi> Act. 20.28.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Cedar Scarlet and Hyſſop, muſt be dipped alſo with it.</hi> verſ. 6. That is, all the concernments of our Salvation, they do all receive a tincture, an influence from the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Whether we refer the myſtery of theſe Plants to the Graces and Excellencies that are in him as our Saviour, or to the Graces we receive from him: all muſt be conſidered with relation to his blood. Take it in the latter, all the Graces, Virtues, Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies we receive from him, muſt be dipped in his blood to cleanſe them, and make them and us accepted of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The living Bird muſt be let looſe into the open field,</hi> verſ. 7.
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:96313:205"/>
This clearly repreſents, not only Jeſus Chriſt his eſcaping and deliverance from death to life: after he had ſuffered and humbled himſelf unto death, he did eſcape and live again, and lives for ever. But alſo the open publication and preaching hereof, as it were in the open Firmament, in the view of all men: ſo that Phraſe imports, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6. <hi>flying in the midſt of Heaven,</hi> preaching the everlaſting Goſpel.</p>
               <p>This reſpects alſo the ſetting of the Leper free from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint that was upon him before, by reaſon of his uncleanneſs, as appears by the Connexion. <hi>He ſhall pronounce him clean, and let the Bird looſe into the open field.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the Ceremonial Actions relating to the living Bird.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Ceremonial Actions in reference to the Leper himſelf, theſe alſo are three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Prieſt ſhall ſprinkle upon him ſeven times, and pronounce him clean.</hi> Verſ. 7.</p>
               <p>This ſprinkling of that typical blood and water upon him, is nothing elſe but the application of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There muſt be a particular application of it to the Soul: it muſt be ſprinkled upon the Leper, and then he is pronounced clean. All the other Ceremonies would not make him clean without this: though the Bird were killed, and other Ordinances obſerved; yet it muſt be alſo ſprinkled.</p>
               <p>The death and blood of Chriſt is not enough to the cleanſing of our Souls, unleſs the blood be ſprinkled, the death of Chriſt applied to us. There muſt be a work of Application, as well as of Redemption.</p>
               <p>All the precious blood that Chriſt hath ſhed, will not ſave a ſinner; unleſs this blood be effectually applied and ſprinkled on the Soul.</p>
               <p>Application is a great and neceſſary part of our Recovery and Salvation, as well as the blood of Chriſt it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And it muſt be applied <hi>ſeven times,</hi> both frequently and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, over and over again; once is not enough, ſuppoſe thou haſt believed and laid hold upon Chriſt already, and applied him by Faith to thy ſelf in particular, (the blood muſt be ſprinkled
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:96313:206"/>
                  <hi>ſeven times over</hi>) thou muſt apply Chriſt, and lay hold upon Chriſt again.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, the number ſeven is a number of perfection: ſo it holds forth perfect cleanſing, as well as frequent application of the blood of Chriſt for that end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Leper muſt waſh his Cloaths and himſelf, and ſhave his Hair, and then come into the Camp; but not yet into his Tent.</hi> verſ. 8. The like Ceremony is required in other Cleanſings.</p>
               <p>As at the Conſecration of the <hi>Levites.</hi> Numb. 8.7. <hi>they were to cauſe a Raſor to paſs over all their fleſh.</hi> And <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.12. Of the Captive Woman it is ſaid, <hi>ſhe ſhall ſhave her head, and pare her nails.</hi> Some allegorize this in a plain and a good way, thus: That it was a figure of caſting away all remainders of malice and filthineſs, <hi>James</hi> 1.21. Thoſe excreſcencies and ſuperfluities of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Corruption, it ſhadows out and teacheth the work of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, or paring away of ſinful ſuperfluities of Luſts and Corruptions, as faſt as they grow, which we cannot be quite rid of, but muſt be paring and cutting them off continually.</p>
               <p>This Expreſſion is uſed <hi>Iſai.</hi> 7.20. in a metaphorical way, to ſignifie the Lords conſuming and weakning their ſtrength: for much hair argueth ſtrength of nature. Hence in age when there is a decay of ſtrength, the hair falls off, and baldneſs comes in ſtead of hair. Therefore in a leprous perſon, it ſeems to argue ſtrength of the Diſeaſe: therefore the ſhaving it off, is thought to ſignifie the cutting off and taking away the ſtrength of the Diſeaſe, and plague of the heart.</p>
               <p>And as to waſhing, this was often required: therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>divers waſhings,</hi> Heb. 9.10. And the Holy Ghoſt refers them to the <hi>blood of Chriſt.</hi> Rev. 1.5. And they reſpect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> often compared to <hi>water,</hi> Iſai. 44.3. This is that <hi>Fountain ſet open</hi> Zach. 13.1. <hi>for the houſe of</hi> Judah, <hi>and the Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to waſh in, for ſin and for uncleanneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſinner muſt waſh and bath himſelf in this Fountain, if ever he will be made clean.</p>
               <p>We read of <hi>the waſhing of Regeneration,</hi> Titus 3.5. which is an alluſion to theſe Ceremonial waſhings, rather than to Baptiſm.
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:96313:206"/>
And the Leper was <hi>to waſh his whole body,</hi> not ſome part only, becauſe Sanctification is <hi>a cleanſing of the whole man.</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.23. And he muſt <hi>waſh his clothes</hi> as well as himſelf.</p>
               <p>To teach us that we muſt purge our ſelves from all manner of filthineſs, and every thing that defileth, <hi>hating the very garment that is ſpotted with the fleſh</hi> Any thing of uncleanneſs, the leaſt degree of it, <hi>Jude ver</hi> 23. <hi>hating even the garments ſpotted by the fleſh:</hi> An amplification, ſaith the Margin, taken from the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things in the Old Law, that did defile, that is, all appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, occaſions, any thing that hath the leaſt touch of ſin. It is a worſe ſign of a leprous graceleſs heart, for a man to dally with his luſt, and to allow himſelf therein, than one particular fall into a groſſer act of uncleanneſs if it be abhorred and repented of.</p>
               <p>Thus the Leper muſt be waſhed: He and his Clothes, and his Hair ſhorn; and yet after all this, he is not to return to his Tent. The reaſon is, Leſt there ſhould be any thing of infection in his Tent. For the very Houſes and Garments ſometimes were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Leproſie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Ceremony, or his after-duty is this. <hi>After ſeven days he muſt uſe the ſame Ceremony of ſhaving and waſhing over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> ver. 9. This plainly teacheth us, that cleanſing work muſt be renewed from time to time. The mortifying and purging out of Corruption, it is a gradual work, and a frequent work. For the Leper is not made clean at once, in the firſt moment, nay af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all his former obſervations, he is not perfectly clean, though he be begun to be made clean, but here are <hi>ſeven days</hi> muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene, and then he muſt waſh and ſhave again. So that it is a gradual work. We ſhould do ſo in Spiritual Cleanſing, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon the Sabbath day, which is the ſeventh in this ſenſe; that is, it is one of ſeven; and it is, and ſhould be a day of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual waſhing and cleanſing.</p>
               <p>Thus you have ſeen the firſt part of this purifying Sacrifice for the Leper, <hi>viz</hi> The two Birds with the ſeveral Ceremonies and Ceremonial actions and performances appertaining to them, both to the ſlain Bird, and to the living Bird, and to the Leper him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:96313:207"/>2. The ſecond part of the purifying Sacrifice appointed for him is that of <hi>three Lambs,</hi> with the Ceremonies thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing: and this is declared at large from ver. 10. to 32. of that 14. Chapter of <hi>Leviticus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Materials of this are <hi>two He Lambs, the one for a Burnt-Offering, the other for a Treſpaſs Offering; and an Ew-Lamb for a Sin Offering; and fine Flower for a Meat Offering; and a log of Oyl.</hi> Theſe are the Materials. Now what muſt be done with them?</p>
               <p>The Ceremonies about them are chiefly theſe three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Sacrifices muſt be ſlain and offered according to the manner and inſtitution,</hi> ver. 12, 13. But this having been opened former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we ſhall not inſiſt upon it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Prieſt muſt put ſome of the blood of them upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleanſed,</hi> ver. 14. <hi>and ſome part on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have the like Ceremony, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.20. injoined in the Conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons.</p>
               <p>The ſprinkling theſe parts did repreſent, and was inſtead of ſprinkling the whole body. The ſprinkling of a part of the body was appointed by God, as ſignificative of univerſal cleanſing of the whole man.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Engl. Annot. on Exod. <hi>29.20.</hi>
                  </note>Our Annotators have this Note upon it. The Ear was to be ſanctified for holy hearing, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the hearing of any corrupt communication<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the Hand for working; and the Foot for walking, that his Converſation might be holy, and his Perſon ſanctified from head to foot. So in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> there is no neceſſity of plunging the whole body in water; but the ſprinkling of it on the Forehead may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſignifie the myſtical meaning intended by it, where by a Sacramental Synechdoche, though but a part be ſprinkled, the whole is waſhed and cleanſed.</p>
               <p>This is the ſecond Ceremony ſome of the blood in theſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the three Lambs muſt be put upon the Leper.</p>
               <p>The 3d. is, That <hi>the Prieſt is to take the Oyl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſprinkle part of it before the Lord, and with part to anoint the Leper; his Ear, Thumb and Foot, in the place where he had put the blood before, and pour the reſt upon his head.</hi> ver. 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:96313:207"/>This myſtical Oyl whereof they had ſuch continual uſe under the Law, we have often heard, that it typifies the Holy Ghoſt: and therefore the Son of God is ſaid to be anointed with the Spirit. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.1. And <hi>Act.</hi> 10.38. <hi>God anointed Jeſus of</hi> Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt, and with power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the putting of the Oyl upon theſe parts, ſignifies the ſaving Graces of the Spirit of Chriſt, whereby they are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſanctified and comforted, who have been juſtified and reconciled by his blood.</p>
               <p>As to the putting it upon theſe parts for the whole, this teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us the ſame that was noted before out of the ſame Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny concerning the blood.</p>
               <p>And whereas he muſt put the Oyl upon the blood, that is, upon the ſame place where he had put the blood before, as it is explained more fully <hi>verſ</hi> 28. This teacheth us, that our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication flows from our Juſtification: the blood muſt be applied firſt, and then the Oyl upon it: the Spirit of Chriſt is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of the death of Chriſt: and therefore the Spirit of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is the fruit of the blood of Juſtification. Look not to have thy Soul cleanſed from the power of ſin by Sanctification, unleſs it be cleanſed from the guilt of ſin by the blood of Chriſt applied for Juſtification. We are firſt juſtified and reconciled by his blood, and then ſanctified and anointed by his Spirit. <hi>He forgiveth all thine Iniquities, and healeth all thy Diſeaſes.</hi> Pſal. 103. Juſtification is in order before Sanctification: firſt the blood, and then the Oyl upon the blood.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Laws and Ordinances for the purifying of the Leper.</p>
               <p>But now a Caſe of Conſcience may ariſe: what if the Leper be not able to get all theſe Sacrifices and Requiſites for his clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, what ſhall be done in ſuch a Caſe?</p>
               <p>The Anſwer is, That the Lord hath made a gracious proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the neceſſities of his people: therefore leſſer Sacrifices are provided and appointed in ſuch a Caſe, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 21, to <hi>verſ.</hi> 33. where this Caſe is fully ſpoken to, <hi>viz. in ſtead of three Lambs,</hi> he requires here <hi>but one Lamb, and two Turtle Doves, or elſe two
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:96313:208"/>
young Pigeons, whichſoever he could beſt get.</hi> And <hi>in ſtead of three Omers of fine flower for a Meat Offering,</hi> he requires in this Caſe <hi>but one Omer,</hi> that is, about a Pottle of our meaſure; <hi>and a Log of Oyl,</hi> that is, about half a Pint. This is the ſame that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and theſe leſſer Sacrifices are as effectual for the cleanſing of a poor Leper, as the greater Sacrifices were for richer perſons. <hi>God accepting a man according to that he hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi> 2 Cor. 8.12. The Rites and Ceremonies of theſe, are the ſame with the former: ſo I ſhall paſs from this, obſerving only the gracious Condeſcenſion of God to the ſeveral capacities and neceſſities of his people.</p>
               <p>The latter part of the Chapter, is concerning the cleanſing of <hi>a leprous houſe,</hi> from <hi>verſ.</hi> 33, to the end. Some ſay it was a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar thing in that Land, a ſtrange infection that ſeized the Land in ſome Caſes, the whole Land being a typical Land, as we have heard.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only note two or three general Obſervations from it, and from the whole Chapter, and ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. The marvellous infectious and defiling nature of ſin, in that it infects and defiles other things, <hi>the very houſe and the Garments. To the unclean all things are unclean, as to the pure all things are pure</hi> Tit. 1.15. It poyſons and corrupts all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments and enjoyments of a ſinner. The Apoſtle ſpeaks how <hi>the whole Creation groaneth and travelleth in pain together until now.</hi> Rom. 8.22. <hi>For the Creature was made ſubject to vanity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Stones out of the Walls, and the Timber out of the houſes,</hi> are troubled with a wicked man, and <hi>cry out againſt him,</hi> as <hi>Habakkuk</hi> hath it, Chap. 2.11. That's the firſt Obſervation. Learn the wonderful defilement, and infectious nature of ſin, that it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts all the concernments that a ſinner is concerned in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. Whereas <hi>the leprous houſe,</hi> if it were incurably infected, <hi>muſt be pulled down, and all the Materials of it caſt away.</hi> verſ. 40, 45.</p>
               <p>This teacheth us, that all the Monuments and remainders of leprous and corrupted things, muſt be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Idolatry and Superſtition, is a Leproſie that hath overſpread the whole Chriſtian World, during Popery. And as the Prophet
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:96313:208"/>
ſaith concerning <hi>Babylon,</hi> Jer. 51.26. <hi>They ſhall not take of</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon <hi>a ſtone for a Corner, nor a ſtone for Foundations; but thou ſhalt be deſolate for ever, ſaith the Lord.</hi> It holds true of myſtical <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> that leprous Church, whoſe Idolatry and Superſtition is a ſpiritual Leproſie, which did overſpread the whole Church of God in the time of Popery: therefore away with all the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Remainders of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dwalphintramis</hi> applies this not impertinently to the Popes <hi>Maſs-Book.</hi> The Popes <hi>Maſs Book</hi> was a leprous houſe, the ſtones and timber whereof ſhould have been caſt aſide as polluted and an abomination: therefore it was an unhappy and a fatal error in the firſt Reformation, to take Materials out of that to reform with; to take the ſtones and timber of that leprous houſe to uſe in the Worſhip of God, which muſt be therefore framed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with thoſe leprous polluted things. It hath been the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a new Conflict to the people of God in this Age, and of manifold ſufferings to the ſervants of Chriſt, becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that theſe leprous polluted things ſhould be caſt aſide. This might have been prevented, if there had been a thorough Reformation at firſt, and the ſtones and timber of <hi>thoſe leprous houſes, the Popes</hi> Maſs-Book, <hi>Ritual, Pontifical, and Breviary,</hi> had been at our firſt Reformation caſt forth as pollutted and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. How difficult, and yet withal how neceſſary a work, the purifying and cleanſing of the Leproſie is.</p>
               <p>The Leproſie was a Type of ſin and ſinful Corruption, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that original and univerſal pollution and defilement of our natures: the Purification of the Leproſie therefore, is nothing elſe but the work of Mortification, or purging out of ſinful Corruption.</p>
               <p>This is a difficult work: ſee how many Ingredients muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to it in the <hi>Type:</hi> there muſt be <hi>two Birds, with Cedar, Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let and Hyſſop,</hi> and a great many Ceremonies about theſe Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials. There muſt be <hi>Spring Water, and an earthen Veſſel, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, dipping, ſprinkling, waſhing, ſhaving,</hi> &amp;c. And when all this is done, there is but half the work done: for there muſt be alſo <hi>three Lambs for a Burnt-Offering, a Treſpaſs Offering, a Sin Offering.
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:96313:209"/>
And three Omers of fine Flower with Oyl for a Meat Offering, and a Log of Oyl:</hi> and a multitude of ſacred Rites and Ceremonies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe materials. O how much ado there is to get a Leprous perſon purified and made clean! And all theſe things inſtruct and ſhew you all along the method of the Lords proceeding in puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the hearts of ſinners.</p>
               <p>There muſt be a great deal of pains taken with thy own heart, in the uſe of all the means and Ordinances that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. And though there be all this pains and difficulty in the work, yet it muſt be done, there is a neceſſity of it.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe is very troubleſom and loathſom, and it may be mortal at laſt, if a Cure be not provided in time. Therefore the Leper muſt uſe means, and take pains: And ſo ſhould ſinful Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous ſouls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. That as there is a Leproſie of the heart, as we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed and unclean by nature; ſo there is a remedy and purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Jeſus Chriſt. And as there is an Ordinance of Ejection of ſcandalous Sinners and Lepers out of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> So there is for re-admiſſion of healed Lepers into the Church again. This confutes the <hi>Novatians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 13. Chapter of <hi>Leviticus</hi> reproves promiſcuous Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>This 14. reproves that <hi>Novatian</hi> Error of them who would not re-admit and receive repenting Sinners into the Church again?</p>
               <p>The Scripture is clear for both Binding and Looſing. Binding Impenitent ſinners, and looſing and reſtoring the Penitent.</p>

               <p>WE have been endeavouring (beloved) to take off the Veyl from <hi>Moſes</hi> face, and to unfold and open to you the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of the <hi>Ceremonial Law;</hi> they are dark Shadows, but there are glorious Myſteries adumbrated and ſhadowed forth by them. They are hard Shells, but there are ſweet Kernels within, if the Lord help us to break the ſhell, and to underſtand the myſtery and meaning of them. You have ſeen divers of theſe Shells broken, and what precious Kernels of Goſpel-truths are contained in them.</p>
               <p>You may remember we did refer this Law of Ceremonies to five general heads.</p>

               <p>We have formerly ſpoken to the two firſt of theſe, to wit, the Initiating Seal of Circumciſion, and their Legal Sacrifices and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifications.</p>
               <p>We are now to proceed in the help of Chriſt unto the third, namely,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their Tabernacle and Temple and other Holy places; of which this Text gives you this Doctrinal Aſſertion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> That God was pleaſed to chuſe out certain places to ſtand in a ſpecial relation of Holineſs unto himſelf under the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>See again in this Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 14, 18— <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.35. <hi>Thou art terrible, oh God, out of thine holy places.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>As in</hi> Sinai <hi>in the holy place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is needleſs, and would be eaſie to multiply quotations: For this phraſe, <hi>holy place,</hi> and <hi>holy places,</hi> doth occur in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture above threeſcore times.</p>
               <p>Let me explain and open a little to you the nature of this holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of places that was under the Law.</p>
               <p>You all know there is a two fold Holineſs; Inherent, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Holineſs.</p>
               <p>Inherent Holineſs is nothing elſe, but thoſe ſaving Graces of Sanctification in the Souls of men.</p>
               <p>Now this is only in perſons, it is a thing which places are no way capable of. But the Holineſs that is in places is a Relative holineſs, and it doth conſiſt in a ſeparation or ſetting them apart for God to be peculiarly his.</p>
               <p>That this is the Scripture notion of Holineſs, and that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in reference to Holy places, you may ſee in <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.2, 7. compared with <hi>Joſhua</hi> 20.7. That which in the one place is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Separation, in the other is called Sanctification: <hi>Thou ſhalt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate three Cities for Cities of Refuge,</hi> ſaith the Lord by <hi>Moſes. And they ſanctified</hi> Kedeſh <hi>and</hi> Sechem, ſaith the Text in <hi>Joſhuah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The contrary to Holineſs, is that which is Common or Unclean, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:96313:210"/>God hath a ſpecial propriety in that which is <hi>holy,</hi> it belongs to God as his peculiar, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Sanctifie unto me all the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, it is mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence the neerer to God any place or thing is, the more of <hi>Separation</hi> to his uſe, the more <hi>holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the general notion of it.</p>
               <p>Now to deſcend to ſome particulars.</p>
               <p>This Holineſs of places was twofold, either <hi>tranſient</hi> and meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the preſent time, or elſe more <hi>permanent</hi> and abiding.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>tranſient Holineſs</hi> of places was where the Lord gave viſible appearances of himſelf in his glorious Majeſty to the eyes of his Servants; ſuch places were holy during the time of ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine appearances. So when the Lord appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the burning Buſh, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.5. <hi>the place whereon thou ſtandeſt is holy ground,</hi> and he ſaith the like to <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> cap. 5.15. So Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was holy, and therefore might not be touched, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>Upon the ſame account the Mount where Chriſt was transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured is called the <hi>Holy Mount,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18.</p>
               <p>I call this a tranſient kind of Holineſs, becauſe it continued no longer, but while that extraordinary Preſence continued. There is no more Holineſs in Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> or Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> now, than in any other place.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle calls it the holy Mount from what it was, not that it is ſo ſtill: Therefore it is but a ſuperſtitious thing in the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to go on pilgrimage to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to viſit the <hi>holy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,</hi> and the like, there is no Holineſs in them now.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, there was alſo a more permanent and abiding Holineſs of places under the Law, during that whole legal Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What were theſe Places?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall inſtance chiefly in four particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Land of Canaan</hi> was an holy Land, ſo called <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.12. <hi>the Lord ſhall inherit</hi> Judah <hi>his portion in the holy Land.</hi> It was a Type of Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.14, 16. <hi>they ſought another Country, a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Country, that is, an heavenly; thine eyes ſhall ſee the Land that is very far off,</hi> Iſai. 32.17. glimpſes of Heaven and Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:96313:211"/>And ſome ſpecial places in the Land were holy, as</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Cities of Refuge,</hi> whereof there were ſix, three on this ſide, and three on the other ſide <hi>Jordan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Inſtitution and Ordinance for it you have in <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. the performance in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 20. where theſe Cities are ſaid to be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>And that there was a Goſpel Myſtery in this Ordinance, and what it was the Apoſtle inſinuates <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. <hi>who have fled for refuge, to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Souls flying to Jeſus Chriſt, and finding ſafety and ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there, when purſued by the Law, as the avenger of Blood, is the Goſpel myſtery of that Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> the <hi>Temple,</hi> the <hi>Ark</hi> and all the places where they came, 2 <hi>Chron,</hi> 8.11. <hi>The places are holy whereunto the Ark of the Lord hath come.</hi> The Ark did as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate them, and ſo there was a reverence due to them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> you know, was made in the Wilderneſs by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo was the <hi>Ark;</hi> it marched before them to ſeek reſt for them, till they came into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt place where it was pitched there, was at <hi>Gilgal, Joſh.</hi> cap. 4.19. there it continued about ſix or ſeven years, till <hi>Joſhuah</hi> had conquered the Land, and then it was ſet up at <hi>Shilo, Joſh.</hi> 18.1. there it continued (as ſome compute) 300 years from <hi>Joſhuah</hi>'s time to <hi>Eli</hi>'s; and then the people in a carnal confidence carrying the Ark before them to battel, it was taken captive by the <hi>Philiſtines;</hi> and <hi>Shilo</hi> was rejected of God, and laid deſolate for the wickedneſs of his people <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The Story whereof you have recorded in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.—</p>
               <p>A very inſtructing Providence, to teach them to take heed of carnal reſting in external Ordinances. Yea, Goſpel Ordinances, Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, if thou art a wicked man, will ſtand thee in no more ſtead, than the Ark did them; <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.12. <hi>But go ye now unto my place which was in</hi> Shilo, <hi>where I ſet my Name at firſt, and ſee what I did to it for the wickedneſs of my people</hi> Iſrael.</p>
               <p>And after this, it is obſervable, that the Ark and the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:96313:211"/>
ſo far as it appears out of the ſacred Hiſtory, never met a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain after this parting.</p>
               <p>Which ſhould teach ſuch as pretend to be the Tabernacles of God, in whom he dwells, as every Chriſtian is, to take heed of decays and backſlidings in your Chriſtian courſe. For it may be God and thou may part, never to meet more. We ſee ſad exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of it in many Profeſſors, that after backſlidings never reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their former Glory, they never enjoy the Ark of his Preſence any more as formerly.</p>
               <p>What became of the Tabernacle after the Deſolation of <hi>Shilo,</hi> and after this departure of the Ark from it, the Scripture is in a great meaſure ſilent. Only this we find, that it was at <hi>Nob</hi> in <hi>Sauls</hi> time, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1. and that it was afterwards at <hi>Gibeon</hi> in <hi>Davids</hi> time, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.39.</p>
               <p>And finally, that the Veſſels of it were removed to the Temple after the building of that by <hi>Solomon.</hi> Not, as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſuppoſe, to be laid by there; but rather to be uſed as occaſion was, together with the other Veſſels of the Temple.</p>
               <p>Some think the Tabernacle had a ſtation once at <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> which they gather from that phraſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.17. <hi>and</hi> Samuel <hi>called the people together unto the Lord to</hi> Mizpeh. But this is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, becauſe they might be ſaid to appear before the Lord elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and not only where the Tabernacle was.</p>
               <p>The places where the Ark came are more particularly recorded in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it was carried from <hi>Shilo</hi> into the Field of <hi>Aphek,</hi> againſt the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.2. where the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> took it captive, and carried it from place to place, to <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> to <hi>Ekron,</hi> to <hi>Gath,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>At laſt they ſent it home into the Land of <hi>Judah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt to <hi>Bethſhemeſh,</hi> cap. 6.</p>
               <p>Thence it went to <hi>Kirjath Jearim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thence to the Houſe of <hi>Abinodab,</hi> cap. 7.</p>
               <p>Thence to the Houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Thence to the City of <hi>David, ibid.</hi> ver. 12.</p>
               <p>And finally, it was placed in the <hi>Oracle</hi> in the Temple by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:96313:212"/>
1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.6, 7. where it continued till the Captivity of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;</hi> at which time it was either deſtroyed in the burning of the Temple, or elſe carried away to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and reſtored amongſt the reſt of the Veſſels of the Lords Houſe by <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some indeed think it was never returned, and that the ſecond Temple wanted the Ark.</p>
               <p>But this to others ſeems improbable; becauſe the High-prieſt was annually to miniſter in the moſt holy place, and that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Ark: for he was to ſprinkle the Mercy-ſeat with Blood, of which hereafter.</p>
               <p>But theſe various removals and travels of the Ark to and fro from place to place, may teach us this leſſon, that God hath not tyed himſelf and his Ordinances, and the tokens of his Preſence ſo to any people, but that if they prove unworthy, he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them, and ſeek unto himſelf another habitation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.43. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. <hi>I will remove the Candleſtick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence fourthly, among the holy places <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was very eminent, as being the place of the Temple and Ark, and all the publick Worſhip thereunto belonging, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.2. <hi>In</hi> Salem <hi>alſo is his Tabernacle, and his dwelling place in</hi> Sion. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.2. <hi>The Lord loveth the Gates of</hi> Sion, <hi>more than all the dwellings of</hi> Jacob.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> therefore is made in Scripture a Type of the Church both militant and triumphant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26. <hi>for</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>which is above is free, which is the Mother of us all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore in that magnificent Deſcription of the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick myſtical, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23. amongſt other Elogies, it is called heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> So <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2. the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that comes down from God out of Heaven, as a Bride adorned for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, is the Church throughly reformed in the latter times both in Doctrine, and Order, and Worſhip. Which Purity is begun here, and perfected in another and an higher Glory in Heaven.</p>
               <p>And throughout the Scripture the Elogies given to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> are very high and excellent.</p>
               <p>It is called the <hi>City of God,</hi> Pſal. 46.4.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Elect City,</hi> or the City which God hath choſen, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.32. <hi>but he ſhall have one Tribe for my Servant</hi> Davids <hi>ſake, and
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:96313:212"/>
for</hi> Jeruſalems <hi>ſake, the City which I have choſen out of all the Tribes of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
               <p>It is called the <hi>beloved City, Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> compaſs the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved City, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.9.</p>
               <p>The <hi>holy City,</hi> Matth. 27.53. <hi>many bodies of Saints which ſlept aroſe and went into the holy City.</hi> Rev. 22.19. <hi>God ſhall take his part out of the holy City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>City of the living God,</hi> the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Heb. 12.22.</p>
               <p>It is called the <hi>Throne of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 3.17. <hi>at that time they ſhall call</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>the Throne of the Lord, and all Nations ſhall be gathered unto it, to the Name of the Lord, to</hi> Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is the ground of this Holineſs of theſe places, and how are we to conceive of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You heard in general before, that it conſiſts in this, in the Lords ſeparating of them for himſelf in a ſpecial and peculiar manner.</p>
               <p>But there be four expreſſions in the Text, the explication whereof will a little further clear it.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Lord is ſaid to ſet his Name there.</item>
                  <item>2. Thither ſhalt thou ſeek.</item>
                  <item>3. Thither ſhalt thou come.</item>
                  <item>4. Thither ſhalt thou bring thy holy things.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord is ſaid to <hi>chuſe theſe places to ſet his Name there,</hi> and therefore they are called his Habitation, <hi>even to his Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall ye ſeek;</hi> the meaning is, his Name dwelt there.</p>
               <p>What is Gods Name? and how is it ſet in ſuch a place?</p>
               <p>Gods Name is any thing by which he is known, the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or manifeſtations of himſelf by which he is known amongſt his people, as a man is known by his Name.</p>
               <p>He ſets his Name in ſuch or ſuch a place, when he conſtitutes or appoints it to be the place wherein he will give forth the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries and manifeſtations of himſelf unto his people.</p>
               <p>There be five things here included.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That here were the ſtanding ſymbols and tokens of his Preſence.</hi> The Ark, the Mercy-ſeat, the Altar, the Sacrifices, here they had their abode and reſidence, even in the places that God choſe for that end.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="416" facs="tcp:96313:213"/>2. <hi>In theſe places were viſible appearances of his Glory upon ſpecial occaſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As when <hi>Moſes</hi> had erected and reared up the Tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.34. <hi>then a Cloud covered the Tent of the Congregation, and the Glory of the Lord filled the Tabernalce;</hi> ſo <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.5. <hi>the Lord came down in the Pillar of Cloud, and ſtood in the door of the Tabernacle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So when <hi>Solomon</hi> had finiſhed the Temple, and placed the Ark in the holy place, the Cloud filled the Houſe of the Lord, ſo that the Prieſts could not ſtand to miniſter, becauſe of the Cloud. <hi>For the Glory of the Lord filled the Houſe of the Lord,</hi> 1 King. 8.10, 11. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> likewiſe ſaw his Glory in the Temple, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.1. <hi>I ſaw the Lord ſitting upon a Throne high and lifted up, and his Train filled the Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Theſe places had their typical ſignifications of Chriſt and Goſpel Myſteries:</hi> Therefore much of the Name of God was in them.</p>
               <p>There were chiefly two great Myſteries in them, Chriſt and the Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Temple was a Type of Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 2.19. <hi>deſtroy this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and within three days I will raiſe it up. But he ſpake of the Temple of his Body,</hi> v. 21. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily,</hi> Col. 2.9. <hi>He was a Miniſter of the Sanctuary, and of the true Tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man,</hi> Heb. 9.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It was a Type of the Church,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15. <hi>how thou oughteſt to behave thy ſelf in the Houſe of God, which is the Church of the living God,</hi> Epheſ. 2.20, 21, 22. And it was a Type not only of the whole Church in general, but of every Believer in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. <hi>what, know you not that your Body is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> He dwells in their very Bodies, much more in their Souls.</p>
               <p>The manner how the Deity dwells in theſe Temples is very myſterious and glorious.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Theſe places were appointed of God to be parts, yea principal and eminent parts of his Worſhip.</hi> I ſay, they were parts of his Worſhip or Ordinances; they were ſuch eminent parts of his
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:96313:213"/>
Worſhip, that they did ſanctifie both the Worſhipers, and all the Worſhip performed in them.</p>
               <p>The Altar ſanctified the Gift, the Temple ſanctified the Gold, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.18, 19. The Places did bring acceptance to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; ſo that the Places were principal, and the Duties leſs princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, as ſome expreſs it. <hi>There will I accept them,</hi> Ezek. 20.40.

               <p>For the Uſe of all, there is a fourfold Inſtruction from all that hath been ſaid concerning theſe holy Places under the Law.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Inſtruction is concerning <hi>the Ceſſation of this Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of places under the New Teſtament.</hi> For this being a part of the Ceremonial Law, it muſt needs be ceaſed and vaniſhed away, now that Chriſt the thing ſignified is come.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> have borrowed this (as they do many other of their Superſtitions) from the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some they borrow from the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and others are nothing elſe, but pieces and reliques of the Law of Ceremonies: So is this of the Holineſs of Places, and conſecrating of Churches.</p>
               <p>For there is nothing more clear, than that the difference of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is taken away under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>When the Woman of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Jeſus ſaid unto her, Woman believe me, the hour cometh, and now is, when ye ſhall neither in this Mountain, nor yet at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>worſhip the Father; but the true Worſhippers ſhall worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> Joh. 4.21, 23. He turns her eyes and thoughts away from the difference of Places, to regard and mind the Spirituality of the Worſhip. For as God is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecter of Perſons; ſo he is no reſpecter of Places. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, for that indefinite <hi>[where]</hi> is equivalent to an univerſal, <hi>whereſoever two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them,</hi> Matth. 18.22.

                  </gap>, <hi>in every place;</hi> as was propheſied long before by the Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi,</hi> cap. 1.11. <hi>For from the riſing of the Sun even to the going down thereof, my Name ſhall be great among the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place</hi> (therefore all places are alike) <hi>Incenſe ſhall be offered unto my Name, and a pure Offering,</hi> which before were limited to the Temple.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:96313:215"/>Therefore the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> met in an upper Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Acts.</hi> 1.13. ſo did the Church at <hi>Troas, Acts</hi> 20.8. there they did preach and break bread: therefore all places are alike. Every Place is now a <hi>Judea,</hi> every Houſe a <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> every Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a <hi>Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what a ſtrange thing is this! that men can ſee no Holineſs in the Lords day, but ſlight and oppoſe that; and yet aſſert an Holineſs in Places. Oh the Wrath of God upon ſuch mens Spirits!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſhould there not be publick Worſhip?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, but that may be in places that are not conſecrated. Dr. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> in his <hi>Body of Divinity,</hi> pag. 404. ſpeaking againſt the private Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, he thus explains it in theſe words; <hi>In times of perſecution the Godly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>did often meet in Barns and ſuch obſcure places, which were indeed publick, becauſe of the Church of God there— The Houſe or Place avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing to make it either publick or private, even as whereſoever the Prince is, there is the Court, although it were a poor Cottage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But there it a ſpiritual Preſence of God in the Places; therefore they are holy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It follows not. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. God doth not vouchſafe his Preſence out of reſpect to the Place, but to the Perſons.</p>
               <p>He hath not ſet his Name upon the Place, but only upon the Perſons; and is not preſent with them for the Places ſake, but only preſent in the place for their ſakes who are there aſſembled.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spiritual Preſence of God is not enough to make a place holy; for then all places ſhould be holy, whereſoever Gods People do enjoy Communion with him; and ſo not only dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houſes where there are Family duties, but every private Chamber where there is ſecret Prayer; yea the Fields, the Streets, and ſometimes Priſons, and Dungeons, and Gibbets, and all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whatſoever where the Saints come and enjoy Communion with God in their Spirits, would be holy places. And ſo this Objection lays all places level, the Lord having many precious Saints that walk cloſely with him, who are diſperſed and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:96313:215"/>
up and down almoſt in every corner of the Land.</p>
               <p>Our publick Meeting-places for Worſhip, they have not any ſuch Sacred Symbols of Gods Preſence, as the Temple had, the Ark, the Altar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither have they any ſuch extraordinary viſible appearances of the Divine Majeſty and Glory, as the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had upon ſpecial occaſions: neither have they that typical reſpect unto Chriſt and Goſpel-myſteries: neither are they parts of Worſhip or Ordinances: nor hath God annexed his Worſhip to them. He hath no way ſeparated or ſet them apart unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as his own peculiar: therefore there is no pretenſe for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtr.</hi> 2. The ſecond Inſtruction is this; Learn to preſent your Worſhip unto God by Jeſus Chriſt: for he is the true Temple, and Tabernacle, as hath been ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Therefore that ſtrict Injunction to bring all their Sacrifices thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſignified thus much, that we muſt preſent all our Services and Sacrifices to God in the Name &amp; Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt. Make uſe of Jeſus Chriſt in his mediatory relation, a thing much &amp; often preſſed in the Scripture, as indeed it cannot be too much inſiſted on, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>He is able to ſave to the utmoſt all that ceme unto God by him,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.21. <hi>who by him do believe in God</hi> Joh. 14.6. <hi>I am the way, the truth and the life, no man comes unto the Father, but by me.</hi> Col. 3.17. <hi>And whatſoever ye in word or deed, do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</hi> A thing of abſolute neceſſity, if we deſire either Acceſs unto God, Acceptance witn God, or Influence and Aſſiſtance from God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is no Acceſs unto God, but by this greater and more perfect Tabernacle Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>in whom we have boldneſs, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs with confidence by the Faith of him,</hi> Epheſ. 3.12.</p>
               <p>God, conſidered as in himſelf, dwells in Light inacceſſible, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. <hi>dwelling in the Light which no man can approach unto, whom no man hath ſeen, nor can ſee.</hi> He is glorious and excellent in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but approachable only in Chriſt: we cannot ſee him, nor conceive of him, nor get into his preſence but by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no Acceptance with God out of Chriſt. If you
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:96313:216"/>
bring a Sacrifice to God, and bring it not to the door of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Congregation, Blood ſhall be imputed to that man. <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7. If thou couldſt live like a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saint, ſhine like an Angel, if out of Chriſt, God regards it no more more than the ſacrificing Swines fleſh, or the cutting off of a Dogs neck, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.40. <hi>for in mine holy Mountain, in the Mountain of the height of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaith the Lord God, there ſhall all the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>all of them in the Land ſerve me; there will I require your Offerings and the Firſt fruits of your Oblations, with all your holy things.</hi> All our holy Offerings, our beſt Duties and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices as they come from us are abominable, but through his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation acceptable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There can be no gracious Influence or Aſſiſtance from God, but only in this way, by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble, the Name of the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>defend thee; ſend thee help from the Sanctuary, and ſtrengthen thee out of</hi> Sion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.1, 2. <hi>For in</hi> Salem <hi>is his Tabernacle, and his dwelling place in</hi> Sion; <hi>there brake he the Arrows of the Bow, the Shield, the Sword and the Battel,</hi> Pſal. 76.2.3. It is ſpoken of temporal Deliverance, and may be applied to the Church; there is a protecting Preſence of God there. But it is true in an higher ſenſe concerning Chriſt: Chriſt is the true Sanctuary from whence all our ſtrength and help cometh — <hi>Thou therefore, my Son, be ſtrong in the Grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.1. <hi>Nay in all theſe things we are more then conquerors, through him that loved us.</hi> Rom. 8.37.</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon you conquer not: but Sin and Luſt prevails, and you are worſted by Corruption and Temptation from time to time. There is a ſecret diſtance by unbelief from Jeſus Chriſt; did you come to the door of the Tabernacle, the Lord would ſend you help from the Sanctuary, and ſtrengthen thee out of <hi>Sion:</hi> but men are loth to leave their own home, or loth to break through difficulties; they faint and tire by the way before they get thither, and ſo never come to receive thoſe bleſſed influences, thoſe reviving, Soul-ſtrengthening, Soul-refreſhing influences. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.5, 6, 7. It is a deſcription to the people in their journeys to the Temple— They went through thick and thin, as we uſe
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:96313:216"/>
to ſay, through drought and heat— <hi>till they came before God in</hi> Sion; and there they found what they went for. They met with God there, ver. 10.11 — <hi>better a day there, than a thouſand elſewhere: for there the Lord will give Grace and Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtruct.</hi> 3. Remember that there is a Church-worſhip.</p>
               <p>As there was a moral Worſhip which they were to perform every where: for it was perſonal, and not meerly publick: ſo they had their publick Church-worſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> their Sacrifices and other Inſtitutions which were limited to the Tabernacle, as it was a Type of the Church.</p>
               <p>As no Service is to be offered out of Chriſt: ſo ſome Services are not to be offered out of the Church; for the Tabernacle, as you have heard was a Type of the Church.</p>
               <p>And therefore, as Gods end in this Inſtitution was to lead out their thoughts and deſires and expectations to Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo to prevent Idolatry and Unbelief in that reſpect: ſo likewiſe to prevent Schiſm, and to keep them in the unity of that Church which he had then inſtituted and appointed.</p>
               <p>So now in Goſpel-times look that you partake of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances in Goſpel-Churches: for theſe are the New Teſtament-Tabernacles wherein God dwells, and vouchſafes his bleſſed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>It is often noted, as a great corruption of Worſhip among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they ſacrificed in the high places; yea though they did it to the Lord their God only.</p>
               <p>So in <hi>Manaſſeh</hi>'s time 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 37.17. <hi>Nevertheleſs the people did ſacrifice ſtill in the high places;</hi> after ſome beginnings and degrees of Reformation; <hi>yet unto the Lord their God only.</hi> And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they were not taken away is ſometimes noted to be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs of the people: ſo in <hi>Jehoſaphats</hi> time, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.33. <hi>howbeit the high places were not taken away; for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their Fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea there were ſome good people in thoſe times, who were unconvinced of this truth, that they ought to ſacrifice only at the Temple and Tabernacle— though they were againſt the Worſhip of <hi>Baal,</hi> yet they were not againſt the <hi>high places:</hi> ſo
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:96313:217"/>
we have ſome in our days that are againſt Popery; but they are not againſt mixt Communions. They are not convinced that they ought to preſent their Services and Sacrifices, their publick Worſhip unto God in Goſpel-Temples, that is, in pure Churches, and not among profane people.</p>
               <p>It is ſtrange to ſee the ſupine careleſneſs and ſcepticiſm of ſome mens ſpirits in this particular— they regard not, they care not with whom they join; whether it be a true Church or a falſe Church, whether a pure or an impure Church, whether a Church or no Church.</p>
               <p>Search the Scriptures, and you will find no inſtance, that ever the Lords Supper was diſpenſed but in Churches, Goſpel-Churches, pure Churches.</p>
               <p>The firſt Inſtitution of that Ordinance was in the firſt Goſpel-Church, ſounded by Chriſt himſelf the chief Paſtor, who did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe this Ordinance himſelf to the twelve Apoſtles, who were the Foundation ſtones of the firſt Goſpel-Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>— then again <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. <hi>they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers.</hi> Breaking of Bread is there mentioned amongſt other Ordinances, and therefore not to be underſtood of common but ſacred Bread. <hi>Acts.</hi> 20.7. it is ſaid of the Church of <hi>Troas,</hi> that <hi>they came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the firſt day of the week to break Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame Ordinance alſo was obſerved in the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and whereas corruptions and corrupt members were crept in, the Apoſtle ſpends a whole Chapter in exhorting them to <hi>purge out the old Leven,</hi> 5. ch. of 1. Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>Profeſſors that lie amongſt the Pots, never joyning themſelves as fixed members in any particular Church, though they have opportunity for it, do live in the neglect of a duty, a known du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yea ſuch a neglect as doth infer and carry along with it the neglect of many other duties alſo. For how can Church-Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline be exerciſed, but in the Societies of Gods People; therefore tnis neglect, it expoſeth the Ordinances of Chriſt to contempt and proſtitution.</p>
               <p>It is as great a ſin to receive the Lords Supper in an Aſſembly
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:96313:217"/>
of ignorant and profane people, as it was to offer Sacrifices in the high places; yea it is indeed the very ſame thing. For let thy Conſcience ſpeak. Are ſuch Aſſemblies the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt? Are they the Tabernacles of the moſt High? Doth God dwell there? Is this to go to the door of the Tabernacle with thy Sacrifice, when thou knoweſt thou goeſt into a dunghill of Profaneneſs, into a dungeon of Ignorance, into an Aſſembly of wicked and ungodly men.</p>
               <p>Art thou a Soul that deſireſt communion with Chriſt? Then take his own direction for the obtaining of it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.7, 8. <hi>Go forth by the footſteps of the flock,</hi> this is Church ſociety. <hi>Feed thy Kids by the Shepherds Tents.</hi> Make uſe of the Miniſtry and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Word, who are ſet in particular Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtr.</hi> 4. Labour every one, that his own Soul may be an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for the Lord, a Temple of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>For the Temple ſignified not only the whole Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but every Saint in particular, as hath been ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Let not thy own Soul be, as it is ſaid of <hi>Rome,</hi> Rev. 18.2. <hi>It is become the habitation of Devils, and the hold of every foul Spirit, and a Cage for every unclean and hateful Bird.</hi>

               <p>But let the Spirit of God dwell there; be reſtleſs in thy ſelf, give God in Heaven no reſt, nor thy own Heart within thee any reſt, till thy Soul be an habitation of the Holy Spirit.

               <p>OF their holy places under the Law the chief was the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle</hi> and the <hi>Temple.</hi> The difference between which two, was not in their typical uſe and ſignification, wherein they were the ſame; but only that the one was movable, the other fixed. The Tabernacle was a movable Temple, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was a fixed Tabernacle: and accordingly they differed in their quantity and dimenſions, the Temple being double the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Tabernacle, ſuitable to its fixed ſtate; but the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle was leſſer and lighter, becauſe it was to be portable and fit for the ſhoulders of the Levites, who were to carry it from place to place.</p>
               <p>The Temple being the greater and more glorious of the two, I have choſen to ſpeak to that, and in ſo doing ſhall ſpeak of the Tabernacle alſo, ſo far as is requiſite to this end of opening the typical ſignifications of theſe legal ſhadows.</p>
               <p>The Text ſpeaks of two things, the Temple and the Kingdom: it is the former of which I am to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>The Doctrinal Propoſition in the words is this.</p>
               <p>Doctr. <hi>That God appointed</hi> Solomon <hi>to build him a Temple, or an Houſe unto his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Temple is an Houſe inhabited by a Deity.</p>
               <p>As a man dwells in his Houſe, ſo God dwelt in the Temple: or as Satan dwells in the Temples of Idols, and in falſe Churches, which are therefore called Synagogues of Satan, and habitations
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:96313:218"/>
of Devils: ſo God dwells in the Temple, and in the true Goſpel-Churches. I give theſe oppoſite inſtances, becauſe contraries put together do illuſtrate one another.</p>
               <p>To dwell there, is to vouchſafe his Preſence there.</p>
               <p>The Temple was a very great and glorious Type; both the Temple and all the concernments of it were myſtical and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant of Goſpel-truths.</p>
               <p>The general ſignifications of the Temple were Chriſt and the Church, and every individual Saint;<note place="margin">See the Sermon on Deut. <hi>12.5, 6.</hi> p. <hi>409.</hi> where this is proved at large.</note> this in general.</p>
               <p>But, beſides theſe ſignifications of the Temple in general, almoſt all the particulars about the Temple had their particular myſteries and inſtructions.</p>
               <p>They may be referred to five heads, 1. the Builders, 2. the time, 3. the Place, 4. the Materials and Preparations for it, 5. the Parts of the Temple.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Builders;</hi> 1. of the Tabernacle, 2. of the firſt Temple, 3. of the ſecond Temple.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the Tabernacle; <hi>Moſes, Bezaliel, Aholiab.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The people contributed, <hi>Exod</hi> 35. and every Princes Offering at the Dedication of it, is ſet down particularly <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.7. to ſhew that the Lord takes ſpecial notice of the Bounty and Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of his people to Work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the firſt Temple; <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> made vaſt preparations for it, appointed the place, and gave the pattern of it in writing to his Son, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.11, 12— 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.2, 3, 4, 5. and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> had an Army of Workmen that were employed about it, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.23, to the end. One hundred and fifty thouſand Bearers of burdens, thirty thouſand <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for plain work, three thouſand and three hundred Officers, beſides <hi>Hirams</hi> men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſecond Temple; <hi>Cyrus, Iſai.</hi> 44. and 45. <hi>Ezra</hi> 1. <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take theſe Inſtructions from this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The chief Builders were Types of Chriſt, whoſe work and
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:96313:219"/>
office it is, to build the Temple of the Lord. <hi>Moſes, Solomon, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel</hi> were ſo: and ſome think <hi>Cyrus</hi> alſo was a good man, and a Type of Chriſt: but concerning the other there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Obſ.</hi> That all hands ſhould help to carry on Church-work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Obſ.</hi> The Freedom and Soveraignty of God in the choice and uſe of Inſtruments to do his work.</p>
               <p>He choſe <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who was by birth a <hi>Perſian,</hi> he ſingles out and chuſes whom he will. He choſe <hi>Paul</hi> a Perſecuter to be an inſtrument to plant and gather Churches. Strangers of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> Kings of <hi>Perſia; Gentiles</hi> as well as <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be added to the Church. Thoſe that were once ſtrangers to the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they that are far off ſhall come and build in the Temple of the Lord, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The time;</hi> the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was built about the year of the World two thouſand five hundred and thirteen: the <hi>Temple</hi> about four hundred eighty ſeven years after, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.1. <hi>ult.</hi> which fell upon the year of the World three thouſand, according to that account. The <hi>Temple</hi> ſtood from the Dedication of it by <hi>Solomon</hi> to the laſt Deſtruction of it by the <hi>Romans,</hi> about a thouſand years. For to the Captivity in <hi>Babylon</hi> was about four hundred years; the Captivity laſted ſeventy years: From thence to the Death of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> four hundred and ninety years, which is <hi>Daniels</hi> ſeventy weeks, <hi>cap.</hi> 9. After Chriſts Death it was deſtroyed by <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> about forty years after.</p>
               <p>So that it was finiſhed and dedicated about the year of the World three thouſand, and finally deſtroyed about the year of the World four thouſand: ſo it ſtood from firſt to laſt about a thouſand years, <hi>viz.</hi> the fourth millenary from the Creation of the World, excepting the interciſion of the Captivity in <hi>Babylon.</hi> It lay waſt about fifty years, a whole Jubile, ſome think ſeventy, but the leaſt is fifty; ſuppoſing their bondage under the yoke of <hi>Babylon</hi> to begin about 20 years before the burning of the <hi>Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all this we ſee the viciſſitudes and various revolutions that do befall the Church of God, whereof the <hi>Temple</hi> was a Type; and that the ingratitude and unprofitableneſs of a people may
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:96313:219"/>
bring Deſolation upon all their pleaſant things. The greateſt glory of external Ordinances may by ſin be laid in the duſt, as this <hi>Temple</hi> was twice. And moreover the uſe of it was ended, <hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſubſtance being come.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Place; Mount Moriah</hi> was the place of the <hi>Temple:</hi> there was a double deſignation of the place to this uſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By <hi>Iſaacs</hi> being offered there, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. <hi>get thee to the Land of</hi> Moriah, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the Angels ſtaying there, and commanding an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar to be built there in <hi>Davids</hi> time, and Gods anſwering <hi>David</hi> from Heaven by fire on that Altar, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. with <hi>cap.</hi> 22.1. We may here learn the Soveraignty and unſearchable freedom of the Will and Grace of God in chooſing one place to be the Seat of his <hi>Temple,</hi> of his Church and Ordinances rather than another. For it was ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.2. <hi>He loveth the Gates of</hi> Sion, <hi>more then all the dwellings of</hi> Jacob. Why he choſe this I know no reaſon can be given, but the good Pleaſure of his own Will.</p>
               <p>So, that the Lord ſhould chuſe <hi>England</hi> to have Goſpel-Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples here, to plant his Churches and Ordinances here, rather than in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy;</hi> he hath reprobated them to be the ſeat of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> but hath choſen theſe to be <hi>the Mountains of delights of Holineſs,</hi> as <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.45. No account can be given hereof, but the good Pleaſure of his Will.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Materials and Preparations</hi> of them; there were the choiceſt Materials and the moſt plentiful Preparations for them: the people contributed to the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> very liberally, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.21, 29. <hi>Exod.</hi> 36.5, 6, 7. So that Proclamation was made for them to ceaſe. And for the <hi>Temple</hi> was prepared Gold, Silver, Braſs, Iron, Wood, Stone, all in great abundance and vaſt Sums by <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe rich and choice Materials inſtruct us, that we muſt give God the beſt we have, and give it plentifully and liberally.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There muſt be a preparing time, and work for the building of the Temple, which to do is Gods free Gift: therefore we muſt acknowledge and admire him for it, as <hi>David</hi> did, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14. <hi>who, or what am I or my people, that we ſhould offer ſo willingly.</hi>
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:96313:220"/>
And the way to continue this frame, is to beg it of God, as there <hi>David</hi> alſo doth, ver. 18. <hi>keep it for ever in the hearts of thy people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Parts;</hi> which I ſhall mention now, but deferring the interpretation of them to another time; they were three, the <hi>Houſe,</hi> the <hi>Courts,</hi> and the <hi>Veſſels:</hi> all theſe, were parts of the <hi>Temple,</hi> take it in the largeſt ſenſe, for all the holy Buildings and appertainances thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Houſe,</hi> or Building, the covered Temple.</p>
               <p>Of this there are the common parts that belong to every Houſe, namely, the Foundation, the Walls, the Doors, the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, the Floor, the Roof.</p>
               <p>The peculiar parts of this houſe, as it was the houſe of the Lord, were the Porch, the Sanctuary, and the Oracle, with the ſide-chambers belonging to them. Theſe are the parts of the Houſe it ſelf, or the covered Temple.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond general part of the Temple, is the <hi>Courts</hi> about it: for they were holy ground, as well as the covered Building; and they were two, the outward and the inward Court; or the Court of the People, and the Court of the Prieſts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Veſſels;</hi> they were many. I ſhall inſtance only the chief, and ſuch as were ſignificant of Goſpel-myſteries, and they are either belonging to the Sanctuary, or to the Oracle.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the Sanctuary, and that either <hi>ſub dio,</hi> or <hi>ſub tecto,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or within doors. There were four without doors, and three within: without, the Brazen Altar of Burnt-offering, the molten Sea, the Lavers, and the Pillars of Braſs: within, the Altar of Incenſe, the Table of Shew-bread, and the Candleſticks.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the Oracle, wherein was the Ark and the appertainances thereof, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.1—to 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Exhortation unto Temple-work. It is propheſied that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Gentiles, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6. ult. <hi>they that are far off ſhall come and build in the Temple of the Lord.</hi> We are all by nature <hi>far off,</hi> Epheſ. 2. <hi>but brought nigh by the Blood of Chriſt, and built up into an holy Temple to the Lord,</hi> as it there follows, ver. 13, 17, 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the end.</p>
               <p>Take theſe Rules about Temple-work.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:96313:220"/>1. <hi>Be ſure you build according to the Pattern</hi> ſhown in the Mount to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 25.9— <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5. It is eighteen times repeated in the two laſt Chapters of <hi>Exodus, [as the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> Moſes: <hi>ſo did he</hi>] as the Lord commanded <hi>Moſes.</hi> And in like manner <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the <hi>Geneva</hi> Note upon it.</note> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.11, 12, 19. they had both the Word and Spirit of God to direct them.</p>
               <p>If you ask, how may we know the Pattern? Theſe are the means of knowing it; the Word and the Spirit, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.5. and they give light in this matter in the way of effectual Humiliation and Repentance: eſpecially repent and be humbled for Temple-ſins, Temple-defilements; for your Church-ſins, Church-defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſins againſt the Worſhip of God, ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.10, 11. ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1. a Reed is given at the reſtoring of the Churches and Worſhip of God from the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Apoſtacy, to meaſure the Temple, the Altar and the Worſhippers. Get this meaſuring Reed into your hands the Word of God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Leave out the outer Court,</hi> Rev, 11.2. that is nominal Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Look to the matter of the Church, elſe it will be like rotten timber in the foundation of a Building: Not that I do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you to rigour and ſeverity; I know there may be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream on both hands: but take heed of extreams, and of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting perſons viſibly unfit. Theſe two Directions are of that weight, that I have thought they are enough as to Communion of Churches. If they own the Scripture for their Rule of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Diſcipline, if they build by the golden Reed, and if they leave out the outer Court; if there be care taken to keep off promiſcuous Adminiſtrations. But if they ſlight the Scripture as the rule of their Walking, or of their Worſhip and Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Or if they be not in a capacity to keep the Ordinances pure, I do not ſee how we can have comfortable communion with them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Let there be no noiſe of Axes and Hammers in building the Temple.</hi> It was built entirely of hewed and ſquared ſtones, whereof every one was perfectly fitted for its place, the length of the ſtones, ſome ſay, being the thickneſs of the Wall, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 6.7.
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:96313:221"/>
It is not to be too rigorouſly underſtood, but the meaning is is, as ſome expreſs it, no ſound that was obſtreperous to a publick diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance: no laborious ſound from the hewing or ſquaring of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but only a more cheerful, yea melodious harmony from the conjunction and compacting of matter afore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>d fitted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs this was not without a myſtery: it may be divers ways applied; as, that the matter of the Church ſhould be well prepared before their admiſſion as members: and that the Saints are aforehand fitted and prepared unto Glory: ſo that when they come to dye, they have nothing elſe to do but to dye: for the Temple was a Type of Heaven, and of the Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant. But the Application that I would make of it, is this: There ſhould be no noiſe of ſtrife, no contention, no colliſion of mens ſpirits in Church-ſociety. And the means to avoid this, is the well preparing of the matter: when the Soul is well prepared by an humbling work in its firſt converſion, when hewed and ſquared, it will lye even in the building, elſe not. For by Pride only comes Contention.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Build the Houſe of the Lord before your own Houſes:</hi> ſo <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon did.</hi> The Lords Houſe was finiſhed in ſeven years, but his own was not finiſhed till thirteen years, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> with <hi>cap.</hi> 7. 1. not that he regarded his own Houſe more, but leſs; and therefore finiſhed the Lords Houſe before his own. And the Jews, after their return from the Captivity, are greatly reproved for this neglect, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.4. and 2.19. It is indeed the general ſcope of the whole book of <hi>Haggai.</hi> It brings a Bleſſing upon all your concernments, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God, and all other things ſhall be added.</hi> But if this be neglected and poſtponed, God will blaſt and curſe all the other works of your hands, as he did theirs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Labour to ſee the Beauty of the Lord in his Temple.</hi> This was <hi>Davids</hi> earneſt deſire, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. <hi>One thing I have deſired of the Lord, that will I ſeek after, that I may dwell in the Houſe of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the Beauty of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 84.7. <hi>to appear before God in</hi> Sion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.2. <hi>to ſee thy
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:96313:221"/>
Power and thy Glory in thy Sanctuary.</hi> What do you come there for, if you do not meet with God there? Be in the pureſt way of Worſhip, but reſt not in it without God. Get real viſions and fruitions of God in his Ordinances, to ſee the pleaſant Beauty of the Lord in his Temple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But when is God real to the Soul in his Ordinances?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> When God is as real to the Soul, to the eye of Faith, as the external part of an Ordinance is to the eye of ſenſe. When you ſee Chriſt crucified in the Sacrament, when you ſee his Body broken, his Blood poured out, as really as you ſee the Bread broken, and the Wine poured out. And if there be a real ſight of Chriſt, it will have real effects, to ſubdue thy Luſts, to keep the heart in ways of Holineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what of God are we to ſee in his Temple?</p>

               <p>I call them all parts, for want of a fitter term to expreſs it by: for there is a penury of words, from whence there is a neceſſity ſometimes of tropes, and figures, and improprieties of ſpeech.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Houſe it ſelf;</hi> that is, the covered Building called <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="1">1. <hi>The common parts of it,</hi> which belong to every Houſe, and ſo to this amongſt the reſt. And here the Scripture takes notice of the Foundation, the Walls, the Doors, the Windows, the Floor, and the Roof of the Temple.</p>
               <p>Not that we ſhould ſeek a myſtery in every thing, but only ſo far as we ſee the Scripture going before us we may ſafely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, when we find the Scripture allegorizing any thing and allud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it in a ſpiritual ſenſe, we ſhould mind, and heedfully take out ſuch leſſons and inſtructions.</p>
               <p>I muſt ſpeak firſt to the Letter and Hiſtory of them, as parts of the material Temple; and then conſider what myſtical appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the Scripture makes of them. This method I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve under every head.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Foundation</hi> of the Houſe of the Lord; it was of great coſtly hewn ſtone, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.17. But what is the Foundation in the Foundation in the ſpiritual Temple? The Scripture often applies this to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Iſai. 28.16. <hi>behold I lay in</hi> Sion <hi>for a foundation, a ſtone, a tryed ſtone,</hi> &amp;c. 1. Pet. 2.4-6. <hi>to whom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to a living ſtone, diſallowed indeed of men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>refuſed of the Builders,</hi> Pſal. 118.22. <hi>the ſtone which the Builders refuſed is become the head of the corner.</hi> A Scripture often interpreted in the New Teſtament concerning Chriſt— <hi>other foundations can no man lay,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.9, 11. The Scripture often ſpeaks of Chriſt under this notion, as a Stone, and a Rock, and a Corner-ſtone, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.24. from thence is <hi>the Shepherd the Stone of</hi> Iſrael— Dan. 2.25. <hi>a Stone cut out of the Mountain without hand.</hi> Iſai. 26.4. <hi>Truſt ye in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord</hi> Jehovah <hi>is everlaſting ſtrength.</hi> The word is, the Rock of ages; in which Rock <hi>Moſes</hi> was hid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.22. <hi>while my Glory paſſeth by, I will put thee in a clift of the Rock.</hi> And <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 Kings 19.9, 13. <hi>He is that Stone,</hi> Zech. 3.9. <hi>ingraven with ſeven eyes upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> it.</hi> And as Chriſt is the foundation-ſtone of the Church: ſo the Apoſtles in regard of their Doctrine are alſo called the Foundations of it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20.21. Look to it, that you be built upon this foundation, that you be not built upon the Sand, but upon this Rock, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:96313:222"/>
7.24. For hence it is that the Church ſtands ſo ſafe, becauſe built upon this Rock: therefore <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it,</hi> Matthew 26.18.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts make the <hi>Pope</hi> the Corner-ſtone of their Church: but it is not the <hi>Pope,</hi> it is not <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf as perſonally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the Church is built upon.</p>
               <p>Many build upon the ſandy foundation of their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and their own ſtrength and moral endeavours. Theſe are falſe foundations. But if you be upon this foundation, fear not; <hi>whoſoever believeth in him ſhall not be confounded</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Walls</hi> of the Temple; they were of Stone, the inſide was Cedar, adorned with carved Cherubims, Palm trees, Flowers, and overlaid with Gold; and yet further adorned with precious Stones, fixed, and ſparkling like Stars in fit places in the Wall, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.18, 29— 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.6. The outſide of the Wall was either white poliſhed Marble, as ſome think, or overlaid with Silver, as others conceive from 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.4. <hi>For within it was overlaid with Gold.</hi> Therefore this Silver, as it ſeems, was for the outſide, which could not but yield a very bright and glorious ſhew to the eyes of all ſpectators, eſpecially when the beams of the Sun did ſhine and ſparkle upon it. The thickneſs of the Wall of the Temple is not expreſſed in the Scripture: but the leaſt that can be allowed at the foundation is four cubits; becauſe there was a rebatement of three cubits in the thickneſs of the Wall for the ſide-chambers, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.6. and for the Wall in the higheſt ſtory, we may well allow one cubit, and ſo there will be four at the bottom.</p>
               <p>The Scripture appies this myſtically to the <hi>new Jeruſalem, Rev.</hi> 21.12. it had a Wall great and high, and again, v. 17. and often the Walls are mentioned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Walls</hi> of an Houſe or City are the defence and ſafety of it: ſo <hi>Iſai.</hi> 60.18. <hi>thou ſhalt call thy Walls Salvation</hi>— And God is ſaid to be a Wall of Fire, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.5. <hi>for I, ſaith the Lord, will be unto her a Wall of Fire round about, and will be the Glory in the midſt of her</hi>— the Lord is for Walls and Bulwarks to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26.1.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="436" facs="tcp:96313:223"/>2. The <hi>Stones</hi> in this ſacred Building are ſpiritually Saints, who are called <hi>living Stones,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. So ſome interpret that alluſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.12, 13. <hi>that our Daughters may be as Corner-ſtones, poliſhed after the ſimilitude of a Palace. Vide Calv, Ainſw. in locum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe <hi>Trees</hi> that were placed in the Temple either for uſe, as Timber in the Building, or for Ornament in Sculptures and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravings, and the <hi>Flowers,</hi> I find them myſtically applied in the Scripture to the Saints and People of God in the Church. The Trees themſelves could not be planted in the Temple; but therefore the Sculptures of them were there, as repreſenting the Trees themſelves. <hi>David</hi> compares the righteous to the Cedar and the Palm-tree, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.12, 13, 14. and himſelf unto the Olive-tree, which was uſed in and about the Doors of the Houſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.8. <hi>but I am like a green Olive-tree in the Houſe of God.</hi> There were alſo Sculptures of Lillies in the Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.19, 22— and Saints are ſet forth by that Flower, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.2. <hi>As the Lilly among the Thorns: ſo is my Beloved among the Daughters,</hi> Cant. 2.16. <hi>my Beloved he feedeth among the Lillies.</hi> The alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeems to lye in the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit of God, ſhadowed by the excellent properties of thoſe Trees and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>precious Stones</hi> have the like ſignification. Thoſe ſpiritual excellencies in the true Temple, thoſe divine Graces and Ornaments of the Soul, more precious than Gold and Jewels, were ſhadowed forth by them. Therefore Faith is compared to Gold, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6. And the Church is ſaid to have <hi>her Foundations of Agats,</hi> Iſai. 54.11, 12. So the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is a Viſion and Propheſie of the Church in her excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy both of Grace and Glory, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.18, 19. And the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, <hi>Lament.</hi> 4.7. are compared to Rubies and Saphires.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Doors</hi> of the <hi>Temple;</hi> they were made with folding leaves; and for the Sanctuary, they were of Fir-tree, with carv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cherubims, Palm-trees and Flowers— overlaid with Gold; and the Poſts of Olive-tree. But for the Oracle, both Poſts
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:96313:223"/>
and Doors were of Olive-tree, 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> chap. 6. ver. 31, 35.</p>
               <p>Now for the Myſtery of this, take theſe hints.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt himſelf is the Door of entrance and admittance into the Temple and Preſence of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.7, 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Ordinance of Admiſſion into the Church, or keeping or ſhutting out, is hereby figured alſo. For the uſe of a Door is to let in ſome, and keep out others, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.12. <hi>A Garden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed is my Siſter, my Spouſe, a Spring ſhut up, a Foountain ſealed.</hi> Rev. 21.27 <hi>There ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomination, or maketh a ly; but they which are written in the Lambs Book of Life.</hi> And chapt. 22.15. <hi>Without are dogs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Windows</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> 1 Kings 6.4. <hi>and for the Houſe he made Windows of narrow Lights.</hi> Your Margin reads it, Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows broad within, and narrow without, or skewed and cloſed. They were made in that form, for the better diffuſion of the Light, and keeping out the Weather. Theſe Windows were of a great height from the ground: for they muſt needs be above the ſide-chambers, which were fifteen cubits high, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.10. therefore the loweſt part of the Windows was fifteen cubits from the Pavement.</p>
               <p>Whether the Oracle had Windows in it or no, is diſputed on both ſides. It is a queſtion alſo whether there was any Glaſs in theſe Windows: but had the Invention of Glaſs been ſo ancient, probably there would have been not only much uſe, but expreſs mention of it in the Scripture. It is ſaid of <hi>Ahaziah</hi> long after <hi>Solomons</hi> time, that <hi>he fell through a Lattice,</hi> 2 Kings 1.2. and thence ſome infer, that probably Glaſs-windows were not then in uſe. And indeed when was the firſt Invention of Glaſs, by that little ſearch that I have made, I cannot find. I find no clear mention of it in the Old Teſtament. For their Looking-glaſſes were of poliſhed Braſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 38.8. I know ſome ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>miſrepoth majim— Joſh.</hi> 11.8. and 13.6. <hi>Fornaces vitraceas,</hi> the Glaſs-furnaces, which I confeſs is ingenious. But it may be otherwiſe rendred; and it doth not ſeem probable, that this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Glaſs was ſo ancient as <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> time. Therefore the
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:96313:224"/>
Windows of the Temple were open to the Air, and as to Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we may ſuppoſe they were gilded or golden Lattices. But ſo much for the literal explication of them.</p>
               <p>As to the myſtery of them, their uſe being to let in Light into the <hi>Temple;</hi> we may here conſider both external and internal Light.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to <hi>external Light;</hi> this ſpeaks forth Light, Goſpel-light in the Church from Chriſt by his Miniſters For Chriſt himſelf is the true Light, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>that was the true Light, which coming into the world enlighteneth every man that is enlightened;</hi> ſo ſome interpret thoſe words. For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may be referred to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as well as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. He is the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhining in through theſe Windows, <hi>looking through the golden Lattices,</hi> Cant. 2.9.</p>
               <p>His Miniſters are Lights alſo, though he is the Sun; they are but Stars that ſhine with a borrowed Light, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.35. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was a burning and a ſhining Light: and <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.14. Chriſt ſays to his Apoſtles, <hi>Ye are the Light of the world,</hi> and his Church and People ſhine as Lights in the world, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to <hi>internal Light;</hi> ſome apply it yet further to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual illumination of the minds of Gods people. As the eyes are the windows of the Body, and ſo called, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.3. in old age they that look out at the windows are darkned: ſo the eyes and windows of the Soul are the faculty of the underſtanding elevated and ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt, whereby it receives the Light of the Goſpel. There is in the Saints a ſpiritual viſive faculty, thoſe eyes of the Soul, whereby it receives the Light of the Sun of Righteouſneſs darting in his beams of ſpiritual Light into the Soul, Though it is with many as <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>the Light ſhines, but the darkneſs comprehends it not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Floor</hi> of the <hi>Temple;</hi> This was of Planks of Firr, and Boards of Cedar, overlaid with pure Gold, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.15, 30.</p>
               <p>This Leſſon and Inſtruction we may learn out of it; That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing in the Houſe of God is excellent and precious, the loweſt, the meaneſt Saint or Ordinance of Chriſt. The very Floor of the Temple is overlaid with Gold.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="439" facs="tcp:96313:224"/>6. The Scripture takes notice alſo of the <hi>Roof</hi> or Covering of the <hi>Temple,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.9. which was made of boards and leaves of Cedar, laid within with Gold. What the outſide was is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: For it is not likely that the Cedar-boards were expoſed to the injuries of the Weather— but covered, yet not with Lead, that was too poor a mettal to be uſed in this magnificent <hi>Temple,</hi> but either with ſheets of Silver, as ſome think, or with plates of Braſs, as others think.</p>
               <p>The Roof was doubtleſs flatt, according to the cuſtom of of thoſe times; and therefore defended with Battlements, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.8. and adorned with Pinnacles: For the Devil carried our Saviour to a Pinnacle of the Temple, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.5. that is, ſaith the Marginal Note, the Battlement wherewith the flat Roof of the Temple was compaſſed about that no man might fall down, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.8. and though flat, yet might be ſome gentle riſing in the middle, to caſt off the Rain-water.</p>
               <p>The Scripture ſeems to apply the Covering of the Temple as an emblem of divine ſhelter and protection over the Church, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 4.5, 6. <hi>for upon all the Glory ſhall be a Defence,</hi> or as the Margin reads it a Covering— <hi>And there ſhall be a Tabernacle for a ſhadow in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from the ſtorm, and from the rain.</hi> This Covering and Shelter is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.4. <hi>his Banner over me was Love.</hi>

               <p>WE have ſoken of the <hi>Foundation,</hi> the <hi>Walls,</hi> the <hi>Doors,</hi> the <hi>Windows,</hi> the <hi>Floor,</hi> and the <hi>Roof</hi> of the Temple: theſe I call the <hi>common parts</hi> of the Temple, becauſe they are ſuch as are in every houſe, of what form or of what uſe ſoever.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>ſpecial parts,</hi> or the <hi>Rooms</hi> in a houſe may be various and divers, according to the mind of the Architect, and the uſe he puts it to.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:96313:225"/>The <hi>Rooms</hi> in this ſacred Building and Houſe of the Lord were chiefly three, the <hi>Porch,</hi> the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and the <hi>Oracle,</hi> with the <hi>ſide-chambers</hi> belonging to them.</p>
               <p>It will be needful here to ſpeak ſomething firſt concerning the Letter and Hiſtory of theſe things, and then concerning their myſtical ſignifications, becauſe we cannot ſo well ſee the ground and the truth of the myſtical application, unleſs we have a right Idea and conceiving of the Letter of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ype it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And firſt for the literal or hiſtorical explication of theſe parts of the Temple, you may eaſily conceive of them by the form of our Churches, as they are called; only there was a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the poſition or ſituation of the parts; but the parts themſelves are alike in both.</p>
               <p>For firſt there was a great <hi>Court</hi> about the <hi>Temple,</hi> to which anſwers the <hi>Church-yard</hi> about our <hi>Churches.</hi> Then there was a ſtately <hi>Tower-porch,</hi> four times as high as the <hi>Temple</hi> it ſelf: to this anſwers that which is called the <hi>Steeple.</hi> To the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> anſwers the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> And then anſwerable to the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,</hi> is that which we call the <hi>Chancell.</hi> And finally, as the <hi>Temple</hi> had <hi>Side-chambers</hi> and Lodgings for the Levites: ſo there is belonging to our Churches the <hi>Veſtry</hi> and the dwelling houſe for the Miniſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Only there is a difference in the poſition or ſituation of theſe parts. For whereas the <hi>Holy of holies</hi> in the <hi>Temple</hi> was at the Weſt end of it: on the contrary with us, the <hi>Chancell</hi> is ever to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> which was done either in oppoſition to the <hi>Jews,</hi> or in imitation of the <hi>Pagans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to our Churches or publick Meeting-places, the thing it ſelf is neceſſary: For if there muſt be publick Worſhip, there muſt be publick places to aſſemble in. A Meeting-place is a neceſſary appertainance to the Worſhip: and as for this form or faſhion of Building, whatſoever is for uſe or convenience, or moderate Comelineſs and Ornament is lawful and allowable: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no evil in a <hi>Church-yard,</hi> or a <hi>Steeple,</hi> or a <hi>Veſtry,</hi> or an <hi>Houſe for the Miniſter:</hi> but to have a <hi>Chancell,</hi> or one part of the Meeting-place, as more holy than the reſt, in imitation of
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:96313:225"/>
the Jewiſh <hi>Oracle,</hi> this is evil and ſuperſtitious. Publick Meeting-places are neceſſary; but the opinion of Holineſs in them, this is ſuperſtitious. For our Meeting-places do not ſucceed in the room and nature of the <hi>Jewiſh Temple,</hi> as a Temple; but of the <hi>Jewiſh Synagogues,</hi> where they had their moral Worſhip in all their Towns and Cities throughout their habiations.</p>
               <p>It will be uſeful here to ſpeak a little firſt concerning the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions</hi> of theſe ſeveral parts of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and then concerning their <hi>Poſition</hi> or <hi>Situation</hi> to each other.</p>
               <p>And firſt for the <hi>Porch,</hi> it was a hundred and twenty cubits high, twenty cubits long, and ten cubits broad. This appears by comparing and putting two places of Scripture together, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.3. with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.4. In the <hi>Kings</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>And the Porch before the Temple of the Houſe, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the Houſe, and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the Houſe.</hi> In 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.4. the height is mentioned, the height was one hundred and twenty cubits. It is not to be ſuppoſed, that it was all void to the top; but that it had Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and winding Stairs up to the top, according to that in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.11. which ſpeaks of the <hi>pattern of the Porch and of the Houſes thereof, and of the Treaſures thereof, and of the upper Chambers thereof, and of the inner Parlours thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And a gallant proſpect it was from the top of this Tower-ſteeple, they might ſee far and neer. Some have written that the River <hi>Jordan</hi> the <hi>dead Sea</hi> and all <hi>Arabia</hi> might be diſcerned: And ſo I ſuppoſe might the <hi>Mediteranean Sea</hi> Weſtward.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this ſtately Porch in the front of the Houſe was chiefly for Ornament to the Houſe it ſelf, to the reſt of the Temple.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond part of the Houſe was the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> or the <hi>holy place,</hi> called ſometimes the <hi>Temple,</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Houſe,</hi> and the <hi>greater Houſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.5. in contra-diſtinction to the <hi>Oracle,</hi> which was the leſſer.</p>
               <p>This was forty cubits long, that is, from Eaſt to Weſt, between the <hi>Porch</hi> and the <hi>Oracle,</hi> 1 Kings 6.17. <hi>and the Houſe,</hi> that is, the Temple before it, <hi>viz.</hi> before the Oracle, <hi>was forty cubits long.</hi>
                  <pb n="442" facs="tcp:96313:226"/>
And ver. 2. <hi>the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thirty cubits.</hi> In this ſtood the Altar of Incenſe, the Table of Shew-bread, and the Golden Candleſticks. And here the Lord was wont to walk as it were amongſt the Golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third part of the Temple was the <hi>Oracle.</hi> This was twenty cubits every way, both in the height, length and breadth, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.10. <hi>and the Oracle in the forepart,</hi> that is, which as a man entred into the Temple lay before him in the Weſt end of it, <hi>was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof:</hi> ſo that it was a perfect cube excavated.</p>
               <p>It had Doors of Olive-tree, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.31 and the Lintel or ſide-poſts were a fifth part of the Wall, that is, four cubits, the Wall being twenty: So there was eight cubits of Wall, beſide eah Door. It may be rendred a little otherwiſe: but thus our Tranſlators; and this ſeemeth the fitteſt proportion for the Doors.</p>
               <p>And here was the Veil hung, namely between the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the Oracle. The Inſtitution of the Veil we have, <hi>Exod.</hi> 26.31, 32, 33. It is ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.14. <hi>and he made the Veil of blue,</hi> &amp;c. And we find, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.21. <hi>he made a Partition by the Chains of Gold before the Oracle,</hi> that is, to hang the Veil upon them.</p>
               <p>It is a Queſtion here, on which ſide of the Wall the Veil hung, whether in the Oracle, or in the Sanctuary, which I ſhall leave to your own Meditations to conſider; as alſo whether the Oracle had Windows. Some think not; becauſe the Scripture, in allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to it, ſpeaks of Gods dwelling in thick darkneſs. So <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> at the Dedication of the Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.12. and of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is deſcribed with ſome alluſion to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Temple. It is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.23. <hi>it had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it: for the Glory of the Lord did lighten it, and the Lamb is the Light thereof.</hi> Neither was the work of the High Prieſt in this <hi>moſt holy place</hi> ſuch as needed any more Light than what the opening of the Doors might
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:96313:226"/>
yield, from the Light that was in the Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>It is further Quere concerning the <hi>Oracle,</hi> whether there were any ſide-chambers over it.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer is, that the Text ſeems clear for it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.1. <hi>and he overlaid the upper Chambers with Gold,</hi> that is, the upper Chambers over the <hi>Oracle:</hi> For the whole Context in thoſe three verſes, 8, 9.10. treateth concerning the <hi>Oracle.</hi> It was but twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cubits high, whereas the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> was thirty: Therefore what became of the remaining ten cubits? It is not likely that there was a pair Stairs (as ſome ſuppoſe) of fifteen foot high, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> and the <hi>Oracle,</hi> whereby to aſcend and go up into the <hi>Oracle:</hi> but rather that the remaining ten cubits was made into two upper Chambers, to be repoſitories for the choiceſt things over the <hi>Oracle.</hi> And ſo this brings me to ſpeak a word to the <hi>ſide chambers</hi> of the Temple, of which we read, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.5, 6— <hi>and againſt the Wall of the Houſe</hi> (or upon, or joyning to it, ſaith the Margin) <hi>he built Chambers round about, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Walls of the Houſe round about, both of the Temple and of the Oracle, he made Chambers round about.</hi> The nethermoſt <hi>Chamber</hi> was, five cubits broad, the middle was ſix cubits broad, and the third was ſeven cubits broad. <hi>For without in the Wall of the Houſe he made narrowed Reſts round about, that the Beams ſhould not be faſtened in the Walls of the Houſe.</hi> So that here were three ſtories of Chambers contiguous to the Temple; the loweſt ſtory five cubits broad, the ſecond ſtory ſix cubits, and the uppermoſt ſtory ſeven cubits; which different dimenſions of the <hi>Chambers</hi> aroſe from the ſeveral rebatements that were in the Wall, for the Beams of the Floors to reſt upon.</p>
               <p>The number of theſe <hi>Chambers</hi> is not expreſſed in Scripture: but in <hi>Ezekiels viſionary Temple</hi> there wsre <hi>thirty chambers,</hi> Ezek. 41.6— and the Jewiſh Writers report, that there was the ſame number in <hi>Solomons Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But here it may be demanded, Cubits being ſo often mentioned in meaſuring the Temple, how much a Cubit is?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> A Cubit was about a foot and a half of our meaſure, it comes very neer it, except ſome ſmall fractions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="444" facs="tcp:96313:227"/>The <hi>Oracle</hi> therefore being twenty cubits, was about thirty foot ſquare. The <hi>Porch-tower</hi> being one hundred and twenty cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits high, was about one hundred and eighty foot high.</p>
               <p>Some diſtinguiſh of cubits, and think there were two ſorts of them, the ſacred, and the common cubit, and that the ſacred cubit was double the quantity of the other: And ſo two ſorts of <hi>Shekels,</hi> the Shekel of the Sanctuary, and the common Shekel; and ſo of other Meaſures. But others on the contrary conceive, there was but one Cubit, and but one Shekel: and that phraſe, the Shekel of the Sanctuary, they interpret of exact meaſure, the Standard of all meaſures being laid up in the Sanctuary, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.29. It is true, the Temple is ſaid to be ſo long, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cubits of the firſt meaſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.3. but this is various ways interpreted. Some underſtand it of the Meaſures left in the written Pattern by <hi>David</hi> to his Son <hi>Solomon.</hi> Others underſtand it of the Tabernacle-meaſures left by <hi>Moſes.</hi> See the <hi>Belgick Annot. in</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.3.</p>
               <p>If the Cubit uſed in the Temple were double to the ordinary, there would have needed Pillars in the midſt of the Houſe to ſupport the Roof: but the Scripture ſpeaks not of any ſuch Pillars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But if a Cubit was no more but a foot and an half, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in then conſiſted the Magnificence of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple? For it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.5. <hi>The Houſe that is to be builded for the Lord muſt be exceeding magnifical of Fame, and of Glory throughout all Countries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Magnificence did not conſiſt in the <hi>Houſe</hi> only, but in all the ſacred Buildings, the <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſils</hi> belonging to it. Nor did it conſiſt in the bigneſs, ſo much as in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſneſs of it: for there is a competency and a meaſure in things, which to exceed is not magnificent, but rather monſtrous. It is not the excellency of a dwelling houſe, to have wild vaſt Rooms, but fit Romes for uſe.</p>
               <p>The Sumptuouſneſs of the Temple was unparallell'd. It ſeems in this reſpect to have been incomparably the moſt ſtately Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture that ever was in the world: For I have never read in any
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:96313:227" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Hiſtory of any Houſe beſide this, that was overlaid with Gold all over, both the Walls, and the Roof, and the Pavement of it, and garniſhed with Jewels and precious Stones fixed and ſparkling in the Walls like ſo many Stars in the Firmament.</p>
               <p>But ſo much for the <hi>Figure and Dimenſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Now ſecondly of the <hi>Poſition</hi> or <hi>Situation</hi> of theſe parts to each other, which was this. The <hi>Porch</hi> ſtood to the Eaſt, the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> or <hi>holy place</hi> in the middle, and the <hi>Oracle</hi> in the Weſt end of the Temple.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſtanding in viſion in the inner cap. 8. 16. <hi>he ſaw five and twenty men between the Porch and the Altar, with their backs towards the Temple of the Lord, and their faces towards the Eaſt, and they worſhipped the Sun towards the Eaſt.</hi> And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.1. there is mention of the Gate of the outward Sanctuary, which looketh towards the Eaſt. And again, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.1. <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Waters iſſued from under the threſhold of the Houſe Eaſtward.</hi> For the forefront of the Houſe ſtood towards the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of this was in oppoſition to the heatheniſh Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of thoſe times, who were wont to worſhip towards the Eaſt; and therefore had their doors and entrances into the Temples from the Weſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their <hi>Adyta</hi> and more ſacred places towards the Eaſt end, there their Idols ſtood. As in our Churches in Popiſh times they had a Loft or Gallery over the Chancel, which was called the <hi>Rood-loft,</hi> where all their Idols ſtood; as the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Chriſt, and of the Virgin <hi>Mary, &amp;c.</hi> and amongſt the reſt, they had one great Idol, called the <hi>Rood,</hi> which if it was, as ſome now think, the Picture of an old Man; from thence the poor ignorant people came to conceive of God the Father, as an old Man ſitting in Heaven: though it ſeems rather to be a Wooden Image of Chriſt hanging on the Croſs. See <hi>Acts and Monuments vol.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 302. or a Wooden Croſs only, without any Image hanging on it. From whence is the term <hi>Roodmas,</hi> uſed ſtill in ſome parts of <hi>England;</hi> by which they mean the firſt or third of <hi>May,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> having made that an holy day, and called it <hi>Inventio Crucis,</hi> becauſe forſooth on that day the <hi>Croſs</hi> on which Chriſt was crucified was found, if you will believe the
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:96313:228"/>
Fable; <hi>Maſſe</hi> or <hi>Meſſe</hi> ſignifying in the old <hi>Saxon</hi> a Feaſt, or a ſet time of holy rejoycing, and <hi>Rood,</hi> as it ſeems, a Croſs.</p>
               <p>But this is to be obſerved that in all the Ceremonial Worſhip, the Lord took ſpecial care to keep his people at a diſtance from the heatheniſh Idolatries of thoſe times, he would not ſuffer them to conform at all to thoſe falſe Worſhips, nor to comply with them in the leaſt. And it is a good ſpirit to be zealous againſt ſuch things: but where there is a ſlight, looſe, indifferent, ſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal frame of ſpirit in the matters of Gods Houſe and Worſhip, this ſpirit is not of God, this ſpirit is not of him that calleth you.</p>
               <p>So much for the Houſe it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now ſecondly for the <hi>Courts of the Temple,</hi> there were two of them, the Scripture mentioneth ſo many and no more, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.5. <hi>and he</hi> (Manaſſeh) <hi>built Altars for all the Hoſt of Heaven in the two Courts of the Houſe of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the Tabernacle we read but of one Court, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27.9. for the whole Camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was the outer Court. But about the Temple there two, called the <hi>outward,</hi> and the <hi>inner</hi> Court. The outward Court being the larger, is called the great Court, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.9. and the Court of the people, becauſe here the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came together to be taught, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.9. But though the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came into it; yet it was part of the Temple, and an holy place: For none might enter that were unclean in any thing, for it was the Office of the Porters to keep them back, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.19. And hence it was that the Jews took ſo much offence at <hi>Paul,</hi> when they thought he had brought Greeks into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſo polluted that holy place, <hi>Actt</hi> 21.28.</p>
               <p>There was alſo another Court called the inner Court, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.36. and the higher Court, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.10. and the Court of the Prieſts,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. plura on Rev.</hi> 11.12. This Reference in the Authors Notes ſhews he had written a Diſcourſe on that Text, and indeed ſo he had, which may be publiſhed in time, if God will.</note> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.9. Both theſe Courts, as it ſeemeth did compaſs the Temple on all ſides round about, and they were four ſquare. The length of each ſide of the outer Court was a furlong, as the Jewiſh Witers report, and the whole about half an Engliſh mile in compaſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:96313:228"/>There were alſo, as they report, ſome other Courts added un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe in after times; but becauſe the Scripture takes no norice of them, I ſhall not do it neither. Neither ſhall I ſay any thing of the Walls about the Courts, and the Gates, and other Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings belonging to them, as Chambers, Porches, and Treaſuries to lay the Veſſels and other things in; and for the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites to lodge in. For there is mention 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.11. of the Porch, and of the Houſes therof, and the Treaſuries thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ver. 12. of the Courts of the Houſe of the Lord, and of all the Chambers round about, of the Treaſuries of the Houſe of God, and of the Treaſuries of the dedicate things. Neither need I ſpeak particularly to the myſtical ſignifications of the Houſe and the Courts.</p>
               <p>The whole as conſidered together may be divided into three parts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The outer Court.</item>
                  <item>2. The inner Court, with the Sanctuary.</item>
                  <item>3. The Oracle, or the Holy of holies.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Some apply theſe three parts of the Temple to the three parts of a Chriſtian mentioned by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſſ</hi> 5.23. the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Soul and Body. The Body (ſay they) is ſignified by the open Court, where all may ſee what is done. The Soul (ſay they) may be compared to the Sanctuary, which as it was more holy than the outward Court; ſo is the Soul of man an higher and more divine part than the Body, where by the Lamp of Gods Spirit the Reaſon and Underſtanding is enlightened. The Spirit (ſay they) is as the moſt holy place, where God dwelleth in ſecret by Faith, which, ſaith the Apoſtle, is of things not ſeen nor compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Others apply it to the three parts of the World thus. The outward Court to this inferiour World, where all things lye open to the view and uſe of man. The Sanctuary to the ſtarry Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is full of Lights and Stars, as the Sanctuary had the ſeven Golden Candleſticks, and Gems, and Jewels ſhining in it. The Holy of holies to the third Heaven, wherein God dwelleth; and indeed the Apoſtle himſelf makes it a Type of Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="448" facs="tcp:96313:229"/>There is ſomething of analogy in the thing as to all theſe. But the beſt accommodation of a Type is from Scripture, and from the hints and intimations which the Scripture gives, which (as hath been formerly ſhewed) makes the Temple a Type of Chriſt and of the Church.</p>
               <p>Let us conſider then what Inſtructions theſe parts of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do afford as to both theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to Chriſt himſelf. The Temple was a Type of Chriſt eſpecially in regard of that chief part of it, the Holy of holies, wherein there was a figure or weak repreſentation both of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane Nature. Therefore Chriſt is called the Holy of holies, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>ſeventy weeks are determined to anoint the moſt holy,</hi> or the Holy of holies, that is, to initiate and inaugurate the Lord Jeſus Chriſt into his Mediatorial office. The Veil of the Holy of holies typified his humane nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.20. <hi>through the Veil,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>his Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may draw forth the analogy more at large in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Humane nature did veil the Glory of his Deity, as the Veil of the Temple did conceal the Holy of holies from the eyes of men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was curious Embroidery of Cherubims and other Ornaments upon the Veil, <hi>Exod.</hi> 26.31. <hi>thou ſhalt make a Veil of blue, and purple, and ſcarlet, and fine twined Linnen of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning work, with Cherubims ſhall it be made.</hi> So <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.16. This is not unfitly applied to thoſe excellent Graces of the Spirit, wherewith the Humane nature of Jeſus Chriſt was filled and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Veil ſhutting up the Sanctuary from the ſight and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the people, ſignified the ſhutting up the myſteries of the Goſpel while the old Temple ſtood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8. <hi>the holy Ghoſt this ſignifying, that the way into the holieſt of all was not yet made manifeſt, while as the firſt Tabernacle was yet ſtanding</hi>— There were dark ſhadows then of the myſteries of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The rending of the Veil when Chriſt died repreſents his Sufferings in the Fleſh, or humane nature, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.51. <hi>the
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:96313:229"/>
Veil of the Temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</hi> If the Veil be the Fleſh or the Humane nature of Chriſt, then the rending of the Veil muſt needs be the breaking of his Body, and the ſufferings of his Humane nature.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As by this the Holy of holies was open to the view of all that came to the Temple: ſo under the Goſpel the myſteries of Salvation are made manifeſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.19. <hi>and the Temple of God was opened in Heaven, and there was ſeen in his Temple the Ark of his Teſtament.</hi> Clear diſcoveries of God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As the Prieſt entred into the holy place through the Veil; ſo hath Chriſt into Heaven, and made way for us all to enter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him and with him through his Sufferings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. <hi>neither by the Blood of Bulls and Goats, but by his own Blood he entred in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal Redemption for us;</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2 laſt, <hi>which hope we have, as an anchor of the Soul, both ſure and ſtedfaſt, and which entred into that within the Veil,</hi> that is, into the Holy of holies, <hi>whither the fore-runner is for us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred even Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the firſt accomodation of this Type, even unto Jeſus Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Temple ſignified alſo the Church; and the ſeveral parts of the Temple may be conſidered here alſo.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We learn here that there is a threefold diſtinction of the Church, into viſible, militant, and triumphant.</p>
               <p>The outer Court ſignified the viſible Church, into which all the people came that were clean according to the Law: ſo into the viſible Church come all that make a fair outward profeſſion, though they are not all ſincere, as all were not <hi>Iſrael</hi> that were of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sanctuary and the inner Court ſignified the Church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of true Believers, who are indeed ſpiritual Prieſts unto God.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, the holieſt of all was a Type of Heaven, and of the Church triumphant there; ſo the Apoſtle often, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. <hi>for Chriſt is not entred into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas there was a Wall about the great Court to keep
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:96313:230"/>
out the Gentiles, for none but Jews were admitted: the Apoſtle ſhews that <hi>Chriſt hath broken down the middle wall of partition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us,</hi> Epheſ. 2.14. which he hath done by converting the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and repealing the Ceremonial Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The outer Court muſt be left out in Church-reformation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1, 2. that is, when the matter of the viſible Church is wholly corrupted theſe Gentiles muſt be caſt out, or left out.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas the Materials of the Sanctuary and of the Oracle were the ſame, Cedar-boards and Gold, and garniſhed with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as was ſhewed before, when we ſpake of the Walls of the Temple; hence we may learn this Inſtruction; that Grace and Glory differ not in kind, but only in degree. Grace is Glory begun; Glory is Grace perfected, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. <hi>the Spirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi> A Believer hath eternal life begun in him in this world, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſide-chambers and all the buildings about the Chambers, wherein the Prieſts and Levites had their ſeveral Lodgings and ſtations appointed them, may inſtruct and mind us of thoſe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that are prepared for us in Heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2. <hi>in my Fathers Houſe are many Manſions, if it were not ſo, I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>SO much of the Houſe and the Courts. Now follows the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels or Utenſils of the Temple, the ſacred Houſhold ſtuff or Furniture of this Houſe of God; they were many.</p>
               <p>We read in <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.11. <hi>all the Veſſels of Gold and Silver were five thouſand and four hundred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="452" facs="tcp:96313:231"/>We may diſtinguiſh the Veſſels of the Temple into two ſorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as were of natural neceſſity and conveniency for the Worſhip that was there to be performed; as Knives, Pots, Fleſh-hooks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which had not their particular myſtical ſignifications. But yet thus much we may obſerve from them, that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt inſtrument in the Church of God is of ſome uſe, and therefore not to be deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>And of this ſort there were ſome larger Veſſels: as the Kings Scaffold, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.13. on which he ſtood when he came into the Prieſts Court, to preſent his Sacrifices before the Lord, or upon any other occaſion. For you muſt remember, that though none but Prieſts were ordinarily to reſide and attend there; yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might come into it upon any juſt occaſion, as the Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites did every day, to bring in Wood and Water, and every man that offered Sacrifice was to come wirh it, and lay his hand upon the head of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo the King with his Sacrifices: and ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> did when he dedicated the Temple: For this inner Court ſeems to have been the place of this Brazen Scaffold. It was five cubits long, five cubits broad, and three cubits high: and there was a Pillar annexed, as it ſeemeth, to this Scaffold for the King to ſit or lean upon, where <hi>Joaſh</hi> ſtood at his Coronation, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.14. with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.13. So <hi>Joſiah</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.3. when he made that Covenant before the Lord. Of this nature was alſo the Covert for the Sabbath mentioned 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.18. which ſeems to have been ſome Roof ſtanding upon Pillars, to be ſome ſhelter for the Prieſts from the Rain, when they were to officiate in the Court in Winter-weather.</p>
               <p>It is noted as an act of profaneneſs in <hi>Ahaz</hi> to take it away, becauſe it was an utenſil of natural conveniency for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Worſhip, though not a ſacred veſſel of divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and ſo not a part of Worſhip. Though it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them to inſtitute, or alter any of the ſacred veſſels that were myſtical and ſignificant; yet they might make any thing that was of moral uſe, or natural neceſſity, or conveniency, for the better performance of the Worſhip: As for inſtance, <hi>Ezra</hi> ſtood upon a Pulpit of wood, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.4, 5. to have an Hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:96313:231"/>
or the like, to know the time of the day, it is a weak thing to ſcruple it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But beſide ſuch Utenſils as theſe, there was a ſecond ſort that were myſtical and ſignificant, and they may be referred to two ſorts.</p>
               <p>They were either without doors, or within.</p>
               <p>Thoſe without the doors of the Sanctuary were of Braſs.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that were within doors were of Gold.</p>
               <p>Thoſe without doors were moſt of them <hi>ſub dio,</hi> in the open Court: as the other were <hi>ſub tecto,</hi> within the Houſe it ſelf.</p>

               </list>
               <p>All theſe had their myſtical uſe and ſignification, as in each particular will appear.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The two Brazen Pillars, of which this Text ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>And the Doctrinal propoſition is this.</p>
               <p>D. <hi>That</hi> Solomon <hi>by Gods appointment made two Brazen Pillars at the entrance of the Temple, and called them</hi> Jachin <hi>and</hi> Bo-yas.</p>
               <p>They ſtood before the Houſe. 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 3.15. and before the Temple, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. ſome think without the Porch. But they ſeem rather to have ſtood within the Porch: ſo we render 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.19. —but without the doors of the Sanctuary. For the Porch ſeems to have had no Doors that could ſhut, but only Door-places which ſtood always open. Theſe Pillars were doubtleſs things of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial remark and uſe, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt hath ſaid ſo much of them, and hath deſcribed them ſo largely, both in the book of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> and in the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 13 to 23. and again <hi>v.</hi> 41, 42. and 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.17. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. the 3 laſt <hi>verſes,</hi> and <hi>cap.</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. <hi>v.</hi> 17, 20, 21, 22, 23. And <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw them in his viſionary Temple, <hi>cap.</hi> 40. <hi>ult.</hi> and it is ſaid concerning theſe Pillars, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.22. <hi>ſo the work of the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars was finiſhed,</hi> which (as ſome have obſerved) ſeems to put a
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:96313:232"/>
ſpecial emphaſis upon this above any other of the utenſils of the Temple: for it is not ſaid ſo concerning the Cherubims, or the Sea, or the Candleſtiks, or the Tables.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſum up very briefly what is written in thoſe Scriptures of <hi>Kings, Chronicles</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> before quoted concerning theſe Pillars, as to the litteral deſcription of them. Not quoting the verſe for every particular: for you may read the places at your leiſure, ſave only where any phraſe needs explication.</p>
               <p>The matter they were made of was Braſs: the height was eighteen cubits apiece, both of them amounting to thirty ſix; though there was but thirty five that did appear, one cubit being loſt and ſwallowed up in the conjunction of the Pillars and the Chapiters that did adorn the tops of them: the compaſs or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of each Pillar was twelve cubits, the diameter four: therefore ſome read the 19th ver. of 1 <hi>King.</hi> cap. 7. thus; <hi>And the Chapiters which were on the head of the Pillars of Lilly-work, were in the Porch four cubits,</hi> that is, did comprehend in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter ſo much as would take up four cubits in the floor of the Porch. Moreover, theſe Pillars were hollow in the middle, but they were four fingers thick of ſolid metal; the top of the Pillars was adorned with Lilly-work.</p>
               <p>There were alſo on the top of theſe Pillars two Chapiters, as we tranſlate it, as much as to ſay, heads, becauſe they were on the tops or heads of the Pillars. The word is <hi>Kothereth Coronamentum;</hi> ſo <hi>Arias Montanus &amp; fecit duo Coronamenta, duo Capitella,</hi> as <hi>Pagnin.</hi> two Coronets: it is from the verb <hi>Kitter cinxit, circumdedit inſtar Coronae:</hi> it is the ſame word that is uſed in <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.18. <hi>but the prudent are crowned with knowledge;</hi> which is derived from <hi>Kether, Diadema, Corona.</hi> Theſe Chapiters or Coronets were five cubits in height, and but four cubits diameter; and therefore in an oval form: and ſo the end of the Chapiter reſted in the hole which was at the top of the Pillar. Theſe Coronets were curiouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with nets of Chequer-work, and wreaths of Chain-work, a very artificial work, and with two rows of Pomegranates upon each Coronet, four hundred goodly Pomegranates in all, which were put upon chains in two rows; though but ninety ſix did appear
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:96313:232"/>
upon a chain, the reſt being hid by the Wall. This Coronet or Chapiter upon the top of the Pillar was a curious and comely Crown upon the head of it: or (as ſome note) the Chapiter was like two Crowns joyned together.</p>
               <p>The Pillar on the right ſide, he called <hi>Jachin,</hi> or rather <hi>Jakin,</hi> which ſignifies, he, that is, the Lord will eſtabliſh. <hi>Jakin</hi> is the conjugation <hi>Hiphil,</hi> from the verb <hi>Koun, ſtabilivit, firmavit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Pillar on the left hand, he called <hi>Bo-yaz,</hi> in him is power, from <hi>Bo</hi> in it, or in him, and <hi>Yaz</hi> ſtrong or ſtrength, from the verb <hi>Yazaz roboravit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the literal or hiſtorical part of this Type, theſe two Pillars of the Temple, <hi>Jakin</hi> and <hi>Bo-yaz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the Significations.</p>
               <p>Certainly theſe things are not without a myſtery, not without a meaning: for theſe Pillars were extraordinary, and very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in four reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In their height, being eighteen cubits, that is, ſeven and twenty foot of our meaſure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In their thickneſs and compaſs, being twelve Cubits, that is, eighteen foot in the circle round about.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In their curious and admirable Ornaments; the Lillies on the upper end of the Pillars, and the Coronets or Chapiters upon the tops of them, with the curious chains, and nets, and rows of Pomegranates round about theſe Crowns.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In their uſe; which was not only for Ornament, but as it were to ſupport the Temple, as Pillars do ſupport an Houſe: not that they did ſupport or bear it up properly, as if they had been placed in the material Building, no more than the twelve Brazen Oxen did indeed carry the molten Sea to the four quarters of the world, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.4. but only as in an emblem or figure, as <hi>Abraham received Iſaac in a figure,</hi> Heb. 11.19. ſo here: For the Temple had no Pillars in it, for the Beams of the Roof reſted upon the Walls, as you have formerly heard, and not upon theſe Pillars: but they were an emblem or figure of ſupport.</p>
               <p>Now the Temple is the Church of God; and we may apply this Type three ways.</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="456" facs="tcp:96313:233"/>
                  <item>1. To God and Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>2. To the Church.</item>
                  <item>3. To particular Saints.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. As to God and Chriſt. Theſe Pillars ſpeak the ſupport of the Church of God, by the purpoſe of his Will, and by his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power. Our Faith ſtands upon theſe two Pillars; theſe two do ſupport the Church, and the Churches Faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The faithful purpoſe of God, and good pleaſure of his Will. <hi>Jakin</hi> he will eſtabliſh, here is the reſolved purpoſe of his Will and Love. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23. <hi>He is faithful who hath promiſed.</hi> This includes, (1.) his Purpoſe, (2.) his purpoſe of Love, (3.) his Promiſe, (4.) his unchangable Faithfulneſs in all.</p>
               <p>Thou ſaiſt, I am unworthy. True, but if the Lord will ſave, and will have mercy, who can reſiſt his Will? his purpoſe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable and immovable as Braſs; he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Power of Chriſt, his almighty Power; this is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pillar, <hi>Bo-yas,</hi> in him is power— 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>kept by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God through Faith unto Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou ſaiſt, alas! I am weak, I can do nothing. But therefore depend, and reſt, and ſtay thy ſelf upon this almighty Power, which is able to do above what we are able to ask or think: as <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.20, 21. who was ſtrong in Faith, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that he was able to perform what he had promiſed.</p>
               <p>This is of ſpecial uſe in difficulties, when difficulties and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities do appear. Can the Lord pardon ſuch ſins, heal ſuch backſlidings? Yes; in him is Power. Take both theſe together: Love and good will withour Power is but lame to help us: Power without Love and good will is but deaf to hear us; but both put together is a ſupport firm enough, and ſafe enough for Faith to reſt upon; yea, if thou doubt of the one, improve the other, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.2. <hi>if thou wilt thou canſt:</hi> here be both theſe Pillars; but he could not lean upon the one, he doubted of Gods Will; but therefore he relies upon the other, <hi>thou canſt,</hi> and Chriſt accepts this Faith of his; and therefore ſaith, ver. 3. <hi>I will, be thou clean:</hi> ſo do thou, lean and reſt upon both theſe Pillars,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:96313:233"/>
yea upon either of both and thou art ſafe enough. If thou art not aſſured of his purpoſe; yet then reſt and ſtay thy ſelf upon his Power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider them in reference to the whole Church; here is ſhadowed forth the impregnable ſafety of the Church: <hi>The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it,</hi> Matth. 16.18.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Particular Saints are compared to <hi>Pillars in the Houſe of God,</hi> Rev. 3.12. eſpecially Miniſters, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9— <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>I will make thee an Iron Pillar, and Wall of Braſs;</hi> therefore it is in vain to oppoſe them and contend with them.</p>
               <p>There be two properties of a good Pillar, it muſt be ſtrait and ſtrong. It is a ſad thing when they that ſhould be Pillars in the Houſe of God are warping, and leaning, and bending this way and that way, when they ſhould ſtand upright and ſteady.</p>
               <p>And there were two Coronets upon the tops of theſe Pillars ſo <hi>they that perſevere to the end ſhall receive the Crown of life</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8.</p>
               <p>Theſe Pillars were broken in pieces, and carried away to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> but living Pillars in the ſpiritual Temple ſhall go out no more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12. but abide in the houſe for ever, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.35. A true Believer is (as one ſaith) <hi>Monumentum aere perennius,</hi> more durable then Pillars of Braſs. Would you be aſſured of the Crown of Glory? Is there this rectitude and ſtraitneſs, this ſtrength and firmneſs in the ways of God? thou art then a Pillar in the Houſe of God, and ſhalt go no more out.</p>

               <p>THe Veſſels of the Temple (beloved) we are upon.

               <p>Of the former ſort, there was the Altar of Burnt-offering, the molten Sea, and the ten Lavers; as alſo the two Pillars <hi>Jachin</hi> and <hi>Boyas,</hi> which were of Braſs, and placed either in or by the Porch.</p>
               <p>We are now to ſpeak (as the Lord ſhall enable us) concerning the Altar of Burnt-offering: concerning which we may obſerve this doctrinal Propoſition out of the Text, as the foundation of our Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doctr. <hi>That</hi> Solomon <hi>by Gods appointment made in the Temple a Brazen Altar for Burnt-offering.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt expreſs mention we have of Altars in the Scripture is in <hi>Noahs</hi> time, after the Flood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.20. <hi>and</hi> Noah <hi>builded an Altar unto the Lord, and took of every clean Beaſt, and of every clean Fowl, and offered Burnt-offerings on that Altar.</hi> Concerning Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, we read before in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.3, 4, how <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> brought their Offerings unto the Lord. Whether Altars were as antient as Sacrifices, or whether the Lord afterwards added them as a
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:96313:234"/>
further improvement of his Worſhip, and a further help to the Faith of his people, I ſhall not here diſpute.</p>
               <p>The name in Hebrew is <hi>Mizbeach, quaſi Sacrificatorium,</hi> from <hi>Zebach Sacrificium,</hi> from the Sacrifices offered thereupon: and ſo in Greek, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Sacrificium.</hi> There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hebrew word for it, <hi>Bamah excelſum,</hi> from their aſcending up to it, from whence the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: ſo the Latin <hi>altare</hi> is derived <hi>ab alto;</hi> becauſe their Altars were built on high above the earth, but the Hebrew <hi>Bamah</hi> is more, uſually applied to the idolatrous Altars: <hi>Ara Idolorum Buxtorf.</hi> we commonly tranſlate it high places.</p>
               <p>And here I muſt obſerve the ſame method as in other things, firſt to open the Type and then the Anti-type, firſt the Hiſtory of the Altar, and then the Myſtery of it: for the right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Type, makes way for the better underſtanding of the thing typified.</p>
               <p>Now then as to this great Type, the Altar of Burnt-offering, we may conſider four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Materials of it, they made Altars of Earth upon preſent occaſions; <hi>Moſes</hi> his Altar was of Shittim-wood, but overlaid with Braſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27.1, 2. This was to continue for the conſtant uſe and ſervice of the Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>But how then came it to paſs that the Wood was not burnt and ſet on fire, by the continual fire that was upon the Altar?</p>
               <p>It is anſwered unto this by ſome, That the Fire might be kept in the Grate at a due diſtance from the Wood. And ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer further, that there was an eſpecial Providence in it. God as he ſent down Fire from Heaven upon the Altar: ſo he did li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and over-rule the operation of it at his pleaſure. <hi>Solomons</hi> Altar was of Braſs, within either of Earth or Stone, but not of hewen Stones, that being expreſly forbidden, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.24, 25.</p>
               <p>In that it was of Braſs.</p>
               <p>This was for ſtrength and durablenſs, to bear the Fire that was continually burning upon it, and ſo to repreſent the ſtrength of Chriſt to endure the Wrath of God, without being burnt up and conſumed, and overcome by it. For Braſs is often mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:96313:235"/>
to ſignifie ſtrength, <hi>Job</hi> 40.18. <hi>His Bones are as ſtrong pieces of Braſs. Is my Strength of Stones, or my Fleſh of Braſs?</hi> Job 6.12. Am I not a poor, weak, frail creature? So <hi>Zach.</hi> 6.1. <hi>the mountains of Braſs</hi> ſignifie Gods irreſiſtible Purpoſe and Decree: ſo likewiſe Chriſt is repreſented under that appearance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40.3. <hi>a man whoſe appearance was as the appearance of Braſs:</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.15. <hi>his Feet like unto fine Braſs,</hi> as if they burned in a furnace.</p>
               <p>Theſe Repreſentations have the like myſtery of ſtrength and invincibleneſs.</p>
               <p>[That it was of unhewed Stones:] This inſtructs us, that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane poliſhments do not perfect, but corrupt the Worſhip of God; that which carnal Wiſdom thinks doth adorn, doth indeed pollute; there be no perfect additions. We muſt obſerve the plainneſs and ſimplicity of Inſtitution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the figure and dimenſions of it; it was four ſquare, with four Horns upon the four corners of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> his Altar was five cubits in length, and five in breadth, and three cubits high: But <hi>Solomons</hi> was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and ten cubits high; compare <hi>Exod.</hi> 27.1, 2. with the Text, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.1.</p>
               <p>The four-ſquare form (ſaith <hi>Ainſworth</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> 27.1.) ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies firmneſs and ſtability: therefore the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is four-ſquare, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.16. ſo was the figure of it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48.20. ſo was the Oracle, or moſt holy place in the Temple and Tabernacle too, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.8.</p>
               <p>The height of <hi>Solomons</hi> Altar was too high for any Prieſt to reach; yet they might not go up by ſteps to it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.26. therefore it is thought there was an eaſie aſcent by a declivity on the South ſide, the ground riſing by little and little.</p>
               <p>The largeneſs of <hi>Solomons</hi> Altar beyond that of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle might intimate the inlargement of the Church, and great increaſe of the Worſhippers and Worſhip of God under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which is the myſtery of thoſe great inlargements in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> viſionary Temple beyond <hi>Solomons,</hi> as <hi>Solomons</hi> went beyond <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his Tabernacle.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſituation of the Altar was <hi>ſub dio,</hi> in the open air, that
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:96313:235"/>
ſo the <hi>nidor</hi> and <hi>fuligo,</hi> the ſcent and ſmoak of the Sacrifices might be the leſs offenſive.</p>
               <p>Moreover it ſtood in the Prieſts Court, before the Porch of the Temple, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 8.12. <hi>the Altar of the Lord which he had built before the Porch</hi>— Joel. 2.17. <hi>Let the Prieſts, the Miniſters of the Lord weep between the Porch and the Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The uſe of it was to offer Sacrifice upon, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20 24. <hi>An Altar of Earth ſhalt thou make unto me, and ſhalt ſacrifice thereon thy Burnt-offerings and thy Peace-offerings</hi>— 2 Chron. 8.12. <hi>then</hi> Solomon <hi>offered Burnt-offerings unto the Lord, on the Altar of the Lord which he had built before the Porch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Altar did two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſupported the Sacrifice; for the Sacrifice was laid upon it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſanctified the Sacrifice, and made it holy and acceptable to the Lord. The Altar it ſelf was firſt conſecrated with holy Oyl, <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.1. and then it did conſecrate and ſanctifie other things, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.37. <hi>whatſoever toucheth the Altar ſhall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>the Altar ſhall be holineſs of holineſſes,</hi> or moſt holy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.10.</p>
               <p>But now here comes in a Queſtion; How it came that the Fire of the Altar was not ſometimes put out by the ſhowers of Rain? and how it could ſuffice for the conſuming ſo many Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and that the Sacrifices did not fill the Court with ſoot and ſmoak, and flies and putrefaction from the offal and ordure of ſo many Beaſts there ſlain? Slaughter-houſes are very noyſom and offenſive, eſpecially in Summer-time.</p>
               <p>I meet with a twofold anſwer unto this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Fire of the Altar was no ordinary and culinary Fire, but celeſtial and divine: and as it came down from Heaven, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.1. and was ſo far from being quenchable by Rain or Water, that it would preſently lick it up, as it did, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.38. when the Trench was filled with twelve barrels of Water: ſo it left not ſuch a ſooty feculency behind it as common Fire doth. We ſee in Lightening, how quickly and in an inſtant, it conſumes any thing that reſiſts it. The Altar of the Lord is called <hi>Ariel.
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:96313:236"/>
Iſai</hi> 29.1. that is, the Lyon of God, and a very devouring Lyon it was. <hi>Fuller Piſgah-ſight,</hi> p. 394.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There ſeems to have been ſomething of a peculiar Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in it. The Heathen Temples were ſuch ſtinking places, and ſo infeſted with ſwarms of Flies that came to feed upon their Sacrifices, that the Jews were wont in an holy ſcorn to call the Devil <hi>Baal-zebub:</hi> it is the name of the Idol at <hi>Ekron,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.2 and <hi>Mark</hi> 3.22. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.15. as much as to ſay, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus muſcarum,</hi> the God of flies not able to drive away a flie.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ekronites</hi> it is thought called their Idol, <hi>Bayal zebachim,</hi> the Lord of Sacrifices. Some Heathen Writers ſpeak of Temples built <hi>Jovi</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Greg. Greg. Lexic. ſanct. Tit. <hi>166.</hi>
                  </note> to <hi>Jupiter</hi> the Fly-chaſer.</p>
               <p>But let this ſuffice for the literal explication of this great Type, the Altar of Burnt-offering.</p>
               <p>Now for the myſtery and ſpiritual ſignification of it.</p>
               <p>There hath been a very unhappy miſtake as to this in ſome of the Antients, commonly called Fathers, whoſe darkneſs in this and other points did make way for Popery in after times. They have applyed the Altar to the wooden Croſs on which Chriſt was crucified; they ſay, Chriſt ſuffered <hi>in arâ crucis,</hi> upon the Altar of his Croſs, but this is a weak and low interpretation, yea indeed a dangerous miſ-interpretation of this great Type.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For firſt, the Croſs of Wood was nothing elſe but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of mans cruelty againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: it hath no ſpiritual uſe nor vertue in it, it is no Goſpel-myſtery; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no need it ſhould be typified by ſo great a Type. If there be any thing of old that may any way relate to it, it muſt be ſome ſmall circumſtance of ſome Tye, but not ſuch a great and principal a Type as the Altar.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Altar is greater than the Giſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.19. but the wooden Croſs is not greater or more excellent than the Body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which he gave for us; nor doth it ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie or make Jeſus Chriſt accepted.</p>
               <p>Therefore the wooden Croſs is not the Altar.</p>
               <p>There hath been alſo another weak and impertinent applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:96313:236"/>
of it, which is to be found in ſome books of Devotion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Altar of our Hearts. But wherein the Heart is like an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar I cannot tell. The ſame argument confutes this alſo; It is not thy Heart that ſanctifies thee, or thy Services.</p>
               <p>But then, what is the Altar?</p>
               <p>The Anſwer is, that the Altar is Chriſt himſelf: ſo the Holy Ghoſt himſelf expounds it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how doth the Altar repreſent Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> In two reſpects; in regard of his Deity, and Prieſtly Office.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is Chriſt in regard of his Divine nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe his Humane nature was the Sacrifice, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Deity is the Altar: for in offering Sacrifice there muſt be both a Sacrifice and an Altar. And ſo in Chriſt there are two natures, his Deity and Humanity, whereof the Humane nature being the Sacrifice that was ſlain and offered for us, it remains that his other nature was the Altar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe it is the Altar that ſanctifies the Gift. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.19. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.37. But it was the Deity of Chriſt that gave that infinite vertue and value to his ſufferings. It was his Deity that ſanctified his Humane nature, to be ſuch an acceptable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe the Altar did ſupport and bear up the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. But it was his Divine nature that did ſupport his Humane nature in thoſe unutterable Sufferings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>through the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit he offered up himſelf unto God.</hi> What did that piece of Wood do? It did but cruciate and torture his bleſſed Body, it did not bear up his Spirit. It is true, that Tree did lift up his Body from the earth; but it was another manner of ſupport that was neceſſary to our Salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Altar typifies Chriſt in regard of his Prieſtly Office.</p>
               <p>You know he hath a threefold Office; he is a Prophet, Prieſt and King. The Altar looks chiefly at his Prieſtly Office and the concernments of that; for as a Prieſt he offered Sacrifice, and it is the Altar that doth ſupport and ſanctifie the Sacrifice. Both the Natures of Chriſt have an influence into all his Offices, and
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:96313:237"/>
ſo into his Prieſtly, by which he made ſatisfaction for our ſins.</p>
               <p>To open it a little more particularly, all the concernments of the Altar are full of myſtery and teaching. I ſhall inſtance in ſeven particulars about it, wherein you may ſee ſomething of Chriſt, and of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was but one Altar; the Lord forbad all others, though intended to himſelf, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.22. ſo there is but one Mediator between God and men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts have other Mediators, Saints and Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is to have many Altars: whereas the Lord accepts none but this, nor no Sacrifice but what is offered upon this Altar.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Altar had four Horns upon the four corners of it; they are called Horns becauſe they were made like Horns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but bending towards the top, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.15. <hi>upward ſhall be the four Horns.</hi> The uſe of them was not only for Ornament, but to keep things from falling off the Altar, and to bind the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to them when they were to ſlay it, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.27.</p>
               <p>Horns is an emblem of power, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.25. <hi>the Horn of</hi> Moab <hi>is cut off,</hi> that is, his ſtrength and power, ſaith your Marginal note: <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.3. <hi>he hath cut off in his fierce anger all the Horn of</hi> Iſrael. 1 Sam. 2.1. <hi>Mine Horn is exalted in the Lord,</hi> it is applied to God, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.4. <hi>he had Horns coming out of his hand, and there was the hiding of his power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe four Horns of the Altar ſignified the Power and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſts Prieſthood for the Salvation of his Church gathered together from the four corners of the earth. <hi>Ainſw. in Exod.</hi> 27.1.</p>
               <p>If the Altar be his Deity, the Horns of this Altar is the Power of his Deity, the Horns of an almighty Power. Fly for refuge thither, and thou art ſafe enough. <hi>Joab</hi> fled to the Horns of the Altar, but he was pluckt from thence and ſlain, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.31. according to the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.14. But he that flies to Chriſt and hangs upon the Horns of this Altar ſhall never be pluckt thence, <hi>he that comes to me I will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> Joh. 6.37.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Altar was anointed, and ſo ſanctified unto its Office, <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.9. this is the Sanctification or Inauguration
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:96313:237"/>
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt into his Office; he was anointed with the Spirit above meaſure, not only the Graces thereof in his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, but that glorious Perſon himſelf goes forth by commiſſion from the Father and the Son, as the Son by commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Father, to reconcile and ſave ſinners.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There were divers Veſſels of the Altar belonging to it, for the uſe and ſervice of it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.14. of Braſs, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.47. of Gold, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.17. <hi>alſo pure Gold for the Fleſh-hooks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of which, they being neceſſary inſtruments for the work of ſacrificing, we need not ſeek a particular myſtery and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in every Veſſel, only in general ſome apply them to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Goſpel, the means of Grace which do attend upon the Altar, upon the Service of Jeſus Chriſt in his Church.</p>
               <p>As we have an Altar under the Goſpel, ſo we have Veſſels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this Ordinance, Goſpel-Ordinances, whereof there is great uſe. As the Prieſts could not ſacrifice and officiate about the Altar without Knives, and Fleſh-hooks, and Shovels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo we cannot have communion with Chriſt without means and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Altar was furniſhed with Fire from Heaven, which was to be kept always burning.</p>
               <p>Now what is the myſtery of this ſacred Fire.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Wrath of God againſt Sin; <hi>He is a conſuming Fire,</hi> an everlaſting burning againſt ſin and ſinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>ult. Iſai.</hi> 33.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit of God is compared to Fire, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. <hi>He ſhall baptize you with the holy Ghoſt, and with Fire.</hi> Iſai. 4.4. <hi>When he ſhall have purged the Blood of Jeruſalem from the midſt thereof by the ſpirit of Judgment, and by the ſpirit of burning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is a ſacred Fire that never goes out. We ſhould be careful to keep this Fire burning, take heed of grieving, of quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Word and Ordinances are like unto Fire, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.29. they will burn up and conſume what oppoſeth them, <hi>Rev,</hi> 11.5. its ſaid of the two Witneſſes, that <hi>Fire goes out of their mouths,</hi> that is, the Word of God denouncing the Wrath of God: <hi>fiery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:96313:238"/>
devours the adverſaries,</hi> Heb. 10.27.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We read of fiery tryals and afflictions, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.49. <hi>I am come to ſend fire on the earth.</hi> 1 Pet. 4.12. <hi>Think it not ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fiery tryal;</hi> the fiery tryal of Perſecution by open enemies publickly oppoſing, the fiery tryal of Contention by falſe brethren ſecretly undermining.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Fire of the Altar came from Heaven, Lev. 9.24. 2 <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic.</hi> 7.1. ſtrange Fire is forbidden, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.1.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Humane inventions which he had not commanded them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Carnal Wrath and Paſſion; this is not the Fire of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, but ſtrange Fire, <hi>James</hi> 3.17. <hi>Wiſdome from above is firſt pure, then peaceable,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the wrath of man accompliſhes not the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God,</hi> James 1.20.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The uſe of the Altar in reference to the Sacrifice was to ſupport and ſanctifie it: the Altar did two things, both which Faith is to eye and look unto both as done in Chriſt, and to be done in us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſupport the Sacrifice and bear it up: ſo Chriſt was born up by the power of his Deity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To make it acceptable: ſo Chriſts Sufferings are ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely precious and acceptable with the Lord, through the glory and excellency of his Perſon; there is nothing elſe will bear up a Soul under ſenſe of Guilt but this, to conſider who it was that died and ſuffered for us. It was the Son of God. And the reaſon of many fears and tremblings of unbelief is, becauſe the Soul looks at the Sacrifice without the Altar, looks at the Death of Chriſt, but conſiders not the Altar, the Deity that ſanctifies the Gift.</p>
               <p>As to us, we need both ſupport and acceptance; eye both theſe in Chriſt, eye Chriſt for them to your own Souls.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Support, when the heart is ready to ſink, and to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with the difficulties that do occur, thou art weak, but here is ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Acceptance, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 56.7. <hi>their Burnt-offerings and their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices ſhall be accepted upon mine Altar:</hi> thou art unworthy, but leave thy Gift upon the Altar, and it ſhall be accepted: <hi>whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever toucheth the Altar ſhall be holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="467" facs="tcp:96313:238"/>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. See the unlawfulneſs, yea the abominableneſs of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Altars and Altar-worſhip under the New Teſtament. For the Altar was a Type of Jeſus Chriſt in his Deity and Prieſthood, therefore Altars are ceaſed. For is not Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God? or hath God another Son to dye for us? or do we look for another Goſpel that we muſt build Altars to typifie the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries thereof? Becauſe it lies directly in my way, and it is one of the worſt and groſſeſt of the Superſtitions and Corruptions of Worſhip in our times, I may not well paſs it by: conſider but two things here.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Lords Table is not an Altar, ought not to be ſo called or ſo accounted.</item>
                  <item>2. The many other evils that are involved in this and go along with it.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The Communion Table is not an Altar, and ought not to be ſo called nor ſo accounted. Take three arguments for the proof of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe the Scripture calls it a Table, but not an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; and we muſt ſpeak of God and of his Ordinances, as God himſelf doth in his word. So the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. <hi>ye cannot be partaker of the Lords Table, and of the Table of Devils:</hi> ſo Chriſt, Luk 22.21. <hi>the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the Table.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. An Altar implies a Sacrifice and ſacrificing Prieſts; for Prieſts, Altar and Sacrifice are relatives, and have a mutual and inſeparable connexion and dependance upon one another. But the Lords Supper is not a Sacrifice; nor the Miniſters of the Goſpel Prieſts: therefore the Lords Table is not an Altar. The uſe of an Altar is to offer Sacrifice upon: but when we come to the Lords Supper, do we come to Sacrifice Chriſt again, and to crucifie the Son of God afreſh? No, but we come to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the memory of his Death, who dyed once for all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins of many,</hi> Heb, 9.28. and 7.27.</p>
               <p>To talk of a commemorative Sacrifice is meer non-ſenſe, and a contradiction: for as the Picture of a man is no man: ſo the commemoration of a Sacrifice, is in truth no Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="468" facs="tcp:96313:239"/>If it were a Sacrifice offered upon the Table as an Altar, they ſhould make four Horns upon the four corners of the Table, and they ſhould make a Grate for the Fire, and they ſhould put Fire to their Altars to burn the Sacrifice, even the Bread and Wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. If the Communion Table were an Altar, then it ſhould be greater and better then the Sacramental Bread and Wine, then the Lords Supper it ſelf, and a means to conſecrate them: for the Altar ſanctifies all the Gifts and Sacrifices that are offered upon it, and is greater then the Gift, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.18, 19. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>the Altar ſhall be holineſs of Holineſſes,</hi> or moſt holy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.10.</p>
               <p>But the Table is not greater then the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Table is not an Altar.</p>
               <p>It is true, ſome of the Antients have called it an Altar, but unſcripturally and improperly, as they did alſo uſe other extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant and wanton Metaphors, calling it <hi>Solium Chriſti,</hi> the Throne of Chriſt; whereas Chriſt is not repreſented on the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his Majeſty, as upon a Throne; but in his loweſt humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and deepeſt abaſement, as broken, crucified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe expreſſions of the Fathers,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were unſcriptural, the Scripture doth not uſe ſuch language, nor ſpeak of the Communion Table in ſuch a ſtrain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They have done much hurt in the Church, unawares to thoſe good men, and have been inlets and occaſions of much Superſtition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When they uſed this phraſe of ſpeech, the Sacrifice of the Maſs, and Prieſts, and much other Idolatrous Popiſh traſh was not known nor heard of in the world, neither were there any to be ſcandalized with thoſe phraſes, and to uſe them to ſuch ill ends and purpoſes, as the Papiſts and other ſuperſtitious perſons have improved them: therefore ſuch language is worſe now then it was then.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Others of the Fathers have teſtified againſt Altars, even in the primitive times;<note place="margin">O igen contra Gelſum, l. <hi>4.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Conſider the many other evils that follow and flow from this, and go along with it: from this blind conceit that the Lords Table is an Altar, hence follows</p>
               <p n="1">1. Calling it an high Altar, and making ſteps to go up unto it, which is the very ſame thing with thoſe high places ſo often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the Scripture, which were indeed Altars ſituated in high places, or, as our men phraſe it, <hi>high Altars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The placing theſe high Altars (as they call them) cloſe to the wall, like dreſſers or ſide-tables; this is a piece of ignorant Devotion and Superſtition: for the ſituation of Altars was ever ſuch as that they might be compaſſed round about. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Elijah made a trench round about the Altar,</hi> 1 Kings 18.32, 35. <hi>I will waſh mine hands in innocency; ſo will I compaſs thine Altar, O Lord,</hi> Pſal. 26.6. and, alluding to this ſituation of Altars, the Lord threatens, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.4, 5. <hi>I will ſcatter your Bones round about your Altars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Heathens had a cuſtom (as ſome Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries obſerve) <hi>ut ſacrificantes Aras circum cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerent— Miſtique Altaria circum,</hi>

               <p>Therefore how it came into the heads of our late Innovators to think that ſetting a Table with one ſide cloſe to the Wall like a Dreſſer, is to ſet it Altar-wiſe, I muſt confeſs, I have often won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and I think the beſt account that can be given of it, is the profound ignorance of the Prelates and Papiſts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſetting their Altars at the Eaſt end of the Church is another piece of ſuperſtitious Devotion; this is a ſymbolizing with thoſe old Idolaters, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.16. <hi>they worſhipped the Sun with their faces towards the Eaſt.</hi> And it is a ſymbolizing alſo with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, whoſe Altars, <hi>verſus Orientem ſpectant</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hoſpinian de</hi>

And I note it, that you may ſee it is a thing of ſome weight and moment which the Holy Ghoſt doth ſo inſiſt upon. Carnal thoughts are apt to deſpiſe theſe por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Scripture, and to ſay, there is little in them: but this is from the darkneſs of our minds, and the pride of carnal reaſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>name</hi> by which it was called <hi>Kijor</hi> a Laver, and <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">3. The <hi>matter</hi> whereof it was made was Braſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 38.8. <hi>And he made the Laver of Braſs, and the foot of it of Braſs, of the Looking-glaſſes of the Women aſſembling, which aſſemble at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</hi> For the Invention of Glaſs
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:96313:240"/>
properly ſo called, being not ſo antient as thoſe times, they made uſe of bright poliſhed Braſs for reflection to ſee their Faces. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> molten Sea likewiſe and his ten Lavers were of the ſame mettal, to wit, bright poliſhed Braſs: ſo that in this Veſſel the Prieſts might ſee their ſpots, whether they had waſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves clean or not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>figure</hi> and <hi>dimenſions</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>As to the Laver of the Tabernacle, it is not expreſſed: but it was but ſmall, becauſe it was portable: but the molten Sea of the Temple was larger, the diameter of it was ten cubits, and the circumference thirty, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.23. which is not ſet down in exact Geometrical proportion, which was one and thirty cubits and an half: for the Rule in Geomety is <hi>Peripheria eſt tripla dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metri &amp; ferè ſeſquiſeptima.</hi> But the neereſt round number is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed inſtead of the preciſe number, as is uſual in Scripture. The capacity of it was ſo large, that <hi>it contained two thouſand Baths,</hi> 1 Kings 7.26. but in 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 4.5. it is ſaid, <hi>it contained three thouſand Baths,</hi> which are thus reconciled; that two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand was ordinarily put thereinto, but if filled up to the brim, it might contain three thouſand. A <hi>Bath</hi> contained about eight gallons; by which account four <hi>Baths</hi> make a barrel: ſo as this Sea could contain ſeven hundred and fifty barrels of Water, and five hundred barrels full were ordinarily put into it, <hi>Engl. Annot.</hi> on 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.26. the ten Lavers did contain forty <hi>Baths</hi> a piece.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They had ſeveral <hi>parts</hi> belonging to them, ſome for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſome for neceſſary uſe: as thoſe <hi>rows of Knops,</hi> as 1 Kings 7.24. <hi>or pictures of Oxen,</hi> 2 Chron. 4.3. <hi>in two rows round about the brim of the molten Sea, with the Flowers of Lillies.</hi> And the Lavers had their Borders, Ledges, Underſetters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that which is moſt remarkable is the Baſis, or Foot, upon which they ſtood, which is expreſly and often mentioned by the Holy Ghoſt, and ſeems to have ſomething of ſpecial emphaſis put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>For of the Laver of the Tabernacle it is noted, that it had a Baſis or a Foot of Braſs, and this Foot is mentioned expreſly as oft as the Laver is mentioned, which is five times in that Book
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:96313:241"/>
of <hi>Exodus; the Lavers and his Foot,</hi> Exod. 30.18. and 31.9. and 35.16. and 39.39. and 40.11. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.11.</p>
               <p>Of the molten Sea in the Temple it is noted, that it ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on twelve Oxen: theſe Oxen had their hinder parts inward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sea; but their faces looking towards all the four quarters of the world; three towards the North, and three towards the Weſt, and three towards the South, and three towards the Eaſt, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.4.</p>
               <p>The ten Lavers of the Temple ſtood upon wheels, that ſo they might be removed to any place of the Court, as occaſion might require; each Laver had four wheels.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>place</hi> where they ſtood.</p>
               <p>As to the Laver of the Tabernacle, it is ſaid to have ſtood between the Tabernacle and the Altar, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.18. but as to the place of the molten Sea, thus much is clear in general; that it ſtood in the Eaſt part of the Court, this is certain; but ſome place it in the North-eaſt corner: ſo our Tranſlators read 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.39. <hi>and he ſet the Sea on the right ſide of the Houſe eaſtward over againſt the South, Mimmoul-negeb;</hi> but others read it not over againſt the South, but towards the South, <hi>verſus auſtrum,</hi> that is, in the South-eaſt corner of the Prieſts Court, which <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Viſion ſeems to countenance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.1. <hi>the Waters came down from under the right ſide of the houſe, at the South ſide of the Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lavers were placed five on one ſide, and five on the other ſide of the Court.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>uſe</hi> of theſe famous Utenſils was to waſh thereat, from whence called Lavers or Lavatories. Of the Laver of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle it is ſaid, Aaron <hi>and his Sons ſhall waſh their hands and their feet thereat,</hi> Exod. 30.19. It was anointed and ſanctified to this uſe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 8.11. Moſes <hi>took the anointing Oil, and he anointed the Tabernacle, and the Altar, and the Laver and his Foot to ſanctifie them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The molten Sea in the Temple was for the Prieſts to waſh in, the Lavers for the Sacrifices, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.6. ſuch things as they offered for the Burnt-offering, they waſhed in them, but the Sea was for the Prieſts to waſh in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="477" facs="tcp:96313:241"/>But how did the Prieſts waſh in it?</p>
               <p>Not that they did go with their whole bodies into it; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the Law require them ſo to do, neither indeed could they; for the molten Sea was ſo deep, that it would have drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. But the Text expreſſeth it thus, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.19. <hi>for</hi> Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron <hi>and his Sons ſhall waſh their hands and their feet thereat:</hi> the Holy Ghoſt doth not ſay, they ſhall waſh their whole bodies therein, but only their hands and their feet thereat. And it is cleerer and more ſignificant in the Hebrew <hi>Mimmenu ex illa:</hi> therefore <hi>Ainſworth</hi> renders it therefrom, and his Note is this, to wit, <hi>in the Water that is taken out of the Laver into ſome veſſel of the Sanctuary.</hi> They took Water out of it by Cocks, or Pipes, as they had occaſion. <hi>Vid. Engl. Annot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some think paſſages were made through the heads of the Oxen, to let the Water out of the Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But whence had they this Water that was in the molten Sea?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was the Office of the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> to provide it, and to attend upon all the ſervile work of the Temple. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 9.23, 27. <hi>And</hi> Joſhuah <hi>gave them that day to be Hewers of Wood and Drawers of Water for the Congregation, and for the Altar of the Lord,</hi> (that is for the Prieſts and Sacrifices of the Altar) <hi>even unto this day, in the place which he ſhould chooſe.</hi> And ver. 23. <hi>Drawers of Water for the Houſe of my God.</hi> Hence they came in after times to be called <hi>Nethinims, Nehem.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.10. as much as to ſay, the people that were given or appointed unto that uſe.</p>
               <p>But whence the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> did fetch the Water, it is not much material to inquire about that: they had it either from Wells or Springs neer at hand, or it may be there were ſome Springs even within the Courts of the Temple, as in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> viſionary Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which one calls a viſionary Varniſh upon an hiſtorical ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.1.</p>
               <p>So much for the Hiſtory of this Type.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now for the ſpiritual ſenſe and ſcope of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The main thing aimed at in this typical Sea, or confluence of Waters in the Temple, is our ſpiritual waſhing in the Blood of
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:96313:242"/>
Jeſus Chriſt from ſin and from uncleanneſs: For it is ſaid, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.5. <hi>He hath loved us, and waſht us from our ſins with his own Blood</hi>— 1 Joh. 1.7. <hi>the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> Therefore the Saints are preſented to <hi>John,</hi> after the tribulations and perſecutions of Antichriſt are come to an end, as being <hi>clothed with white Robes,</hi> Revel. 7.9. And how came their Robes to be ſo white and clean? ſee ver. 14. <hi>Theſe are they which came out of great tribulation, and have waſhed their Robes, and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb.</hi> Hence the Holy Ghoſt doth not expreſs it under that phraſe of a Sea of Blood, partly becauſe that Blood and a Sea of Blood is in nature dreadful and horrible, and looks rather like an emblem of deſtruction and miſery, and partly becauſe the ſcope and aim of the Spirit is to deſcribe the Blood of Chriſt from the ſpiritual efficacy of it; which is to make the Soul ſpiritually white and clean. Therefore fitly preſented under the emblem of a Sea, or a confluence of ſpiritual Waters; becauſe as Water waſheth and cleanſeth the Body, ſo doth the Blood of Chriſt waſh and cleanſe the Soul; it waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away the guilt of ſin: <hi>They have waſhed their Robes and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb.</hi> This is that <hi>Fountain which is ſet open for the Houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and for the inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>to waſh in, for ſin and for uncleanneſs,</hi> Zach. 13.1. That great priviledge therefore of Juſtification by the Blood of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are juſtified from the guilt of all our ſins, ſeems to be the thing primarily and chiefly intended in that molten Sea of old, and in this Sea of Glaſs like unto Cryſtal which was before the Throne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scripture ſpeaks alſo of <hi>the waſhing of Regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> it is the Apoſtles phraſe, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. there is a ſpiritual waſhing of the Soul in the regenerating work of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Soul. As in Juſtification we are waſhed from the guilt of ſin: ſo in Regeneration we are waſhed from the inherent filth and dominion of it: therefore in Converſion or Regeneration we are ſaid to be <hi>born of Water and of the Spirit,</hi> Joh. 3.5. that is, of the Spirit working and acting like water to waſh and cleanſe us.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="479" facs="tcp:96313:242" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. There is a Laver of Baptiſm; for God hath inſtituted ſuch an Ordinance as waſhing with Water under the Goſpel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptizing them.</hi> And as there is this general analogy in the nature of the thing: ſo likewiſe in this circumſtance; that as this Sea and Laver was placed in the Courts of the Houſe of the Lord, and they were to waſh therein before they went about the buſineſs and ſervice of the Temple: ſo Baptiſm is the initiating Seal and Ordinance of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Here is ſome ſhadow likewiſe of all Goſpel-Ordinances in general: for look, as this veſſel did contain the Water for the uſe of the Prieſts; ſo do the Ordinances ſpiritually contain the Blood of Chriſt for the uſe of Believers. The Laver was made of the mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Looking glaſſes; and <hi>Solomons</hi> of bright Braſs, wherein as they might ſee their Faces: ſo in the Ordinances a Believer ſees Chriſt as in a Glaſs, which is the difference between the ſtate of Grace and Glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. <hi>for now we ſee through a Glaſs darkly, but then face to face,</hi> as the Apoſtle there expreſſeth it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Oxen under the molten Sea, are the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and eſpecially the twelve Apoſtles, as the number it ſelf intimates: for there were twelve Oxen looking towards all the 4 quarters of the world: ſo the Apoſtles and Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel carry this Cryſtal Sea of the Blood of Chriſt, and the Laver of Regeneration and Baptiſm throughout the world. Miniſters are often compared in Scripture to Oxen, becauſe of the ſtrength and laboriouſneſs of that creature: as 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 9.9. <hi>thou ſhalt muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the Corn.</hi> Doth God take care for Oxen? ſaith the Apoſtle there. I may ſay ſo in reference to this Type now in hand. Did God regard the ſhapes and pictures of Oxen to be ſet under this Temple-Sea? or rather did he not ſet them there altogether for our ſakes? <hi>For our ſakes no doubt this was done,</hi> as the Apoſtle there ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>The Lavers alſo had their Baſes, with their wheels which ſerved for the carrying of the water from place to place, and ſo ſerved for the ſame uſe really, whereof the Oxen were but an emblem. The taking of theſe away is noted as an act of audacious wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:96313:243"/>
and profaneneſs in <hi>Ahaz;</hi> 2 Kings 16.17. <hi>And King</hi> Ahaz <hi>cut off the borders of the Baſes, and removed the Laver from off them, and took down the Sea from the Brazen Oxen that were under it, and ſet it upon a pavement of ſtones:</hi> he having as it ſeemeth no underſtanding at all, nor no ſenſe in him of the ſpiritual myſtery and ſignification of theſe Wheels and Oxen; nor no fear and reverence of Gods Inſtitution, who did ordain and appoint them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The uſe of it being to waſh in, both the Prieſts and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were waſhed in the water of theſe typical veſſels, the Sea and Lavers, <hi>that they dye not,</hi> Exod. 30.19, 20, 21. <hi>For</hi> Aaron <hi>and his Sons ſhall waſh their hands and their feet thereat, when they go into the Tabernacle of the Congregation they ſhall waſh with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they dye not: or when they come neer to the Altar to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to burn Offering made by Fire unto the Lord: ſo they ſhall waſh their hands and their feet that they dye not; and it ſhall be a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute for ever to them, even to him and to his Seed throughout their Generations.</hi> You ſee with what emphaſis and earneſtneſs it is required and ingeminated.</p>
               <p>This teacheth us, that both our perſons and our duties and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices muſt be waſhed and made clean in the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, or elſe we dye eternally, <hi>that they dye not,</hi> it is twice repeated; as both the Prieſts and Sacrifices: ſo both our perſons and our ſervices muſt be waſhed; or elſe the ſame diſaſter that befel <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> may befall us, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>they dyed before the Lord,</hi> Levit. 10.2. It is a fearful thing for men to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in their ſins, in their uncleanneſſes; unwaſhed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanſed from them: <hi>They ſhall waſh, that they dye not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The Laver was never covered, but always open, when the reſt of the veſſels were folded up, <hi>Ainſworth</hi> on <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 14. hath this Note; <hi>It ſeemeth to be not without myſtery, that</hi> Moſes <hi>mentioning Fire-pans, Fleſh-hooks, and other leſs things, ſhould quite omit the Laver,</hi> which uſually is reckoned amongſt the holy things of the Sanctuary, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.16. and 38.8. and 39.39. and 40.30. And as in <hi>Melchiſedeks</hi> Hiſtory, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. he omitted his Parentage, Kindred, Birth and Death, from which ſilence in
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:96313:243"/>
the Story the Apoſtle reaſoneth, as if he had been without Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or Kindred, beginning of days, or end of life, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. ſo here, if it may be lawful to conjecture the like, the Laver is left uncovered, and always open to the eyes of the people, that it might be a lively repreſentation of Gods Grace in Chriſt, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing and opened as an ever ſpringing Fountain, that by the waſhing of the new Birth, by Repentance and Faith in the Blood of Chriſt, we may in all our travels at all times cleanſe our hands and feet, our works and ways, as the Sacrificers did from the Laver, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.19, 20. that albeit the face of the Church is ſometimes hid (as the Tabernacle wrapped up) and the Light of the Word ſhineth not, nor publick Worſhip performed; yet always Gods Elect having Faith in him may waſh and purge themſelves in Chriſt his Blood unto forgiveneſs of ſins, and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Spirit and Salvation. It may be the Holy Ghoſt hath ſome alluſion hereto in that phraſe, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.1. a <hi>Fountain opened</hi> for <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to waſh in for ſin and for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs. Certainly this point of our waſhing and cleanſing by the Blood of Chriſt is of that weight and moment, that it was not without cauſe ſaid of it by <hi>Luther, Hic articulus regnat in corde meo,</hi> this Article reigns in my heart; which he alſo ſtyled <hi>Stantis aut cadentis Eccleſiae articulum,</hi> the point upon which the Church doth either ſtand or fall.</p>
               <p>So much for the Explication of this Type.</p>
               <p>You ſee how full it is of Goſpel-teaching and inſtruction.</p>
               <p>Nor ſhould it ſeem ſtrange that one Type ſhould have ſuch a various and manifold aſpect to ſo many ſeveral Truths at once: For it is uſual, as you have formerly ſeen, and it ſuits beſt with the infinite Wiſdom of the Holy Ghoſt, that one of his teaching ſigns ſhould teach many things at once, and have many ſpiritual leſſons and inſtructions thus included in it.</p>
               <p>And now from the Type thus explained we may gather ſome further light to confirm and ſettle the true interpretation of the Text.</p>
               <p>What is meant by this Sea of Glaſs like unto Cryſtal, I argued before from the alluſion that is carried on all along in the context
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:96313:244"/>
to the Types of the Temple: therefore this Cryſtal Sea in the Text is the ſame with that molten Sea of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, which ſhadowed forth the Blood of Chriſt for Juſtification.</p>
               <p>Now to add ſome further arguments.</p>
               <p>A 2d. May be this. Here are other priviledges and benefits of Chriſt mentioned in the context, which do accompany Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication through his Blood, and go along with it. As in ver. 5. here are <hi>ſeven Spirits before the Throne,</hi> that is the ſanctifying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt. And again, ver. 6. here are <hi>four living creatures.</hi> And cap. 5.11. <hi>many Angels round about the Throne.</hi> Here is the Miniſtry, and a Guard of Angels, and the Spirit of Sanctification: therefore it is not incongruous that the Blood of Chriſt for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication ſhould be alſo mentioned. And this therefore ſeems to be intended in this Cryſtal Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. From the properties and circumſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es belonging to this <hi>Sea</hi> in the deſcription of it, which cannot well be otherwiſe accommodated, I ſhall mention but theſe two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is ſaid to be <hi>before the Throne:</hi> ſo we are ſaid to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God; this is one of the bleſſed effects and manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Glory in the Church: ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23, 24. we are ſaid <hi>to come unto God the Judge of all, and to the Blood of ſprinkling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is called a <hi>Sea of Glaſs, like unto Cryſtal</hi> for pureneſs and excellency. This is ſpoken not as by way of diminution, but to ſet out the Glory of it. All which agrees well to the juſtifying Blood of Chriſt, which is more precious than Gold or Silver, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Foraſmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as Gold and Silver, from your vain converſation, but with the precious Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. From other parallel places in this Book, where the <hi>Sea</hi> is ſpoken of, where it relates to the Blood of Chriſt as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed in the Ordinances; as in the ſecond Trumpet, cap. 8.8. The corruption and declenſion of the viſible Church, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining unto Popery, is ſet out by this, that <hi>the third part of the Sea became Blood,</hi> the Worſhip and Ordinances were infected with deadly corruption. And in the ſecond Vial, cap. 16.3. when the Popiſh corruptions are diſcovered and made to appear, it is
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:96313:244"/>
ſaid, <hi>the Sea became like the Blood of a dead man, and every living Soul in that Sea dyed.</hi> Salvation is not to be had in the Popiſh way of Worſhip, it is deadly unto Souls: inſtead of conveying Chriſt and his Blood to ſave and quicken, it exhibits nothing but the Blood of a dead man. And hence alſo the Saints in the Reformation out of Popery are ſaid <hi>to ſtand upon this Sea of Glaſs mingled with fire,</hi> c. 15.2. The Proteſtant Churches and Reformers have ever inſiſted upon this; <hi>Juſtification by faith in the Blood of Chriſt, and not by Works:</hi> ſo in like manner here in this place; this Sea of Cryſtal before the Throne, is the Blood of Chriſt in the Ordinances for waſhing and cleanſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. There is no other interpretation given by Expoſitors, ſave only that ſome have taken this <hi>Cryſtal Sea</hi> to be the World, and ſay, they are compared to a Sea for tempeſtuouſneſs, to Glaſs for brittleneſs, and to Cryſtal for tranſparency. But, beſide that theſe accommodations are more ingenious then ſolid and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative, it is impertinent to the ſcope of the place, thus to bring in the World here: the whole deſign of the Chapter being to ſet forth the Glory of God in the Church under Temple-images and alluſions, as hath been ſhewed.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore now conclude with a few words, as by way of uſe from all that hath been ſaid upon this <hi>Temple-Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. We have here ſome intimation of the Preeminence of the Goſpel above the Law, in that they had the figures of theſe Myſteries, but we have the things themſelves; and in that the <hi>Temple-Sea</hi> was but of Braſs, but this in the Text is of Glaſs, and not common Glaſs, but Cryſtal. This may intimate ſomething of preference and preeminence of Goſpel-diſpenſations above the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Note here ſecondly the deadly corruption of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Religion,</hi> and the main difference between a <hi>Papiſt</hi> and a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Papiſts want this Cryſtal Sea; it is true, they have a Sea, ſuch as it is: but it is not a Cryſtal Sea, filled with this pure and precious and Soul-cleanſing Blood of Jeſus Chriſt: but theirs is a Sea of dead Blood. They uſe to brag and boaſt much of <hi>the
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:96313:245"/>
Sea of Rome.</hi> Take it for the Seat of their Biſhop, <hi>Romana Sedes.</hi> It is but the <hi>Throne of the Beaſt,</hi> the Seat of Antichriſt. But the Text ſpeaks of a Sea in another ſenſe. And theirs is but a <hi>Mare mortuum;</hi> no Fiſh can live in that Sea, no Soul in that Church, in that Religion.</p>
               <p>But the Proteſtant Churches, they have ſure and firm footing upon this <hi>Sea of Glaſs,</hi> as cap. 15.2. <hi>and I ſaw as it were a Sea of Glaſs mingled with Fire, and them that had gotten the victory over the Beaſt, and over his Image, and over his Mark, and over the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Name, ſtand on the Sea of Glaſs, having the Harps of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is <hi>mingled with Fire,</hi> the fire of the Spirit of God burning and working effectually in them.</p>
               <p>And there is indeed a fire of Contention alſo, and Diviſions, and Differences amongſt Proteſtants; but yet here we ſtand ſafe, even upon the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt for Juſtification, as applied to us in his own Ordinances and Inſtitutions. Here we ſtand with Harps of God, triumphing and rejoycing in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Here is Direction to unclean Souls and defiled Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences what courſe to take, and whither to go for cleanſing. Eſpecially when you are to come before the Throne, to approach into the preſence of God in ſolemn duties: ſtand upon this <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal Sea,</hi> waſh in this Fountain, make uſe of Chriſt in this reſpect. You that complain, O this unclean heart of mine! how ſhall I appear in the preſence of ſuch an holy God? Here is a Sea to waſh in. For your your help therein take theſe four Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. See thy own uncleanneſs and need of cleanſing, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midſt of a people of unclean lips.</hi> (Ther's not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſonal defilements, but defilements by contagion from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) <hi>for mine eyes have ſeen the King the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Before that great and holy God I ſtand with ſuch an unclean, unholy heart. Therefore waſh or elſe you dye, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.20, 21. Aaron <hi>and his Sons ſhall waſh their hands and their feet, that they dye not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="485" facs="tcp:96313:245"/>The reaſon why ſo many Profeſſors prove hypocrites, and ſo dye and periſh at laſt, is becauſe they reſt in a moral way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, they do not live upon Chriſt for Righteouſneſs and Life. They avoid ſome ſins it may be, and perform ſome duties, but reſt there. There is a neglect of Chriſt and of daily waſhing in the Sea of his Blood, and ſo they dye before the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Know and be convinced, that no other means will do it: for <hi>though thou waſh thee with Nitre, and take thee much ſope; yet thine iniquity is marked before me; ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 2.22. you may as ſoon waſh a Blackamoor white, as cleanſe a defiled Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience by duties, and ordinances, and moral endavours without Chriſt; yea they will but make thee worſe: for the Lord will not bleſs them, when carnally truſted to, and reſted in without Chriſt. As ſuppoſe a man were baptized or waſhed in a puddle, in ſome dirty muddy pond, he comes out fouler then he went in: ſo men by their own endeavours and duties become worſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Fountain is ſet open; The Blood of Chriſt is offered, the Lord gives thee liberty to waſh thy ſelf in this Sea. <hi>In that day there ſhall be a Fountain opened to the Houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and to the Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>for ſin and for uncleanneſs,</hi> Zech. 13.1. It is not a Fountain ſealed, but ſet open in regard of the general offer of the Goſpel unto all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence all thou haſt to do for thy ſpiritual cleanſing is only to apply and receive this Blood, this Soul-cleanſing Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt which the Lord ſo freely offers to the: waſhing in this ſpiritual Sea, is nothing elſe but believing and exerciſing Faith in the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Do not object and ſay, Alas! I am defiled and unclean.</p>
               <p>I anſwer. Thou haſt the more need of waſhing; the greater thy defilements be, thou haſt the more need of Jeſus Chriſt, and of his Blood to cleanſe thee, and waſh thee from thy ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. Comfort to Believers, that waſh here for ſin and for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, ſee <hi>Iſai.</hi> 4.4. <hi>when the Lord ſhall have waſhed away the filth of the Daughters of</hi> Sion, <hi>and ſhall have purged the Blood of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>from the midſt thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is a fourfold ground of comfort in this <hi>Cryſtal Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="486" facs="tcp:96313:246"/>1. Here is enough of it, here is a <hi>Sea</hi> to waſh in, there is Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough in the Sea for any man to waſh in though never ſo much defiled: ſo there is vertue enough, cleanſing enough in the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. Thou haſt many ſins, many ſpots, many defilements upon thee; but here is a <hi>Sea</hi> to waſh in: this Type of a Sea ſpeaks the plenty of it: here are not a few drops of Soul-cleanſing, juſtifying Blood; but here is an Ocean of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will take out the deepeſt ſtains, the fouleſt ſpots; <hi>though your ſins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wooll,</hi> Iſai. 1.18.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle inſtanceth in ſome of the fouleſt and blackeſt ſpots, <hi>Adulterers, Thieves, Drunkards,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 6.10, 11. <hi>and ſuch were ſome of you; but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Your Robes are white, if waſhed in this Blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. <hi>theſe are they that have waſhed their Robes, and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, 3. Thou art as clean in reſpect of Juſtification, as if thoſe ſins had never been committed. You are perfectly juſtified, though but imperfectly ſanctified. Therefore juſtified perſons are ſaid to have <hi>no more Conſcience of ſins,</hi> Heb. 10.2. not as though they made no conſcience to commit it. No, that were abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; but the Conſcience is diſcharged and ſet free from guilt, and can look God in the face comfortably and with holy boldneſs. Men uſe to ſay, when they have not committed ſuch or ſuch an evil, my Conſcience is clear: yea, but Conſcience may be clear, though thou haſt committed it, if waſhed and cleanſed from it by the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You ſhould therefore draw nigh with full aſſurance of Faith, being thus waſhed; as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Let us draw neer with a true heart in full aſſurance of Faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, and our Bodies waſhed with pure Water.</hi> When you ſtand upon this cleanſing <hi>Sea,</hi> you ſhould <hi>take the Harps of God into your hand,</hi> as <hi>Revel</hi> 15.2. you ſhould triumph and ſing—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how may I know that I am indeed waſhed in this
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:96313:246"/>
Blood, and accepted through this Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. This Sea of Glaſs is mingled with Fire,</hi> cap. 15.2. and here in the words before the Text; <hi>here are ſeven Lamps of Fire burning before the Throne, which are the ſeven Spirits of God,</hi> ver. 5. There is a Baptiſm of Fire, as well as a Baptiſm of Water, the meaning is this, that Juſtification through the Blood of Chriſt is ever accompanied with Sanctification by his Spirit: therefore if the Spirit of God be burning and working in thy heart, fear not; thou art waſhed in this <hi>Cryſtal Sea</hi> which is before the Throne: if ſanctified by the Spirit of Chriſt, thou art juſtified by his Blood.</p>

unto God by the Death and Blood of Chriſt, the <hi>molten Sea</hi> and <hi>Lavers,</hi> ſignifying our Juſtification by the applying or waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that Blood; and the two Pillars <hi>Jachin</hi> and <hi>Boyas,</hi> which ſignified our perſeverance and Preſervation through the Power and Faithfulneſs and Love of God, till we be crowned with the Crown of Glory.</p>

               <p>We may reſolve the words into theſe five doctrinal Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>the Old Teſtament had Ordinances of Divine Service, and a worldly Sanctuary.</hi> There was a Religion and a way of Worſhip ordained by God in thoſe times as well as now, though that Worſhip was not ſo ſpiritual and evangelical as is the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the New Teſtament: They had Ordinances of Worſhip, and a Seat of Worſhip then; but they were carnal Ordinances, and a worldly Sanctuary, comparatively carnal. But the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances now are ſpiritual, and the Seat of Worſhip ſpiritual: For then it was the material Temple to which God was pleaſed to tye and to annex the publick Church-worſhip and Ordinances of thoſe times: but now the Seat of Worſhip is the ſeveral Churches and Congregations of his People. However a Worſhip, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Worſhip and a Seat of Worſhip they had.</p>

<pb n="489" facs="tcp:96313:247"/>
were the Golden Candleſtick and the Table of Shew-bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſ. 5. <hi>That the Furniture belonging to the Holy of Holies were the Golden veſſels for the offering of Incenſe, and the Ark with its appurtenances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are now to ſpeak concerning the <hi>Furniture</hi> of the <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> of which the Doctrine is this.</p>
               <p>That <hi>the ſacred Furniture or Veſſels belonging to the Sanctuary were the Golden Candleſtick and the Table of Shew-bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was alſo the Golden Altar of Incenſe, though that did in ſome reſpects belong to the Holy of Holies, of which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>But firſt of the Golden Candleſtick; that this belonged to the Sanctuary, you may ſee <hi>Levit.</hi> 24.3. <hi>without the Veil of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony in the Tabernacle of the Congregation ſhall the Lamps burn, &amp;c.</hi> The hiſtory and firſt inſtitution of this Type we have in <hi>Exod.</hi> 25, <hi>Moſes</hi> made but one for the Tabernacle: but <hi>Solomon</hi> made ten for the Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.49. <hi>and the Candleſticks of pure Gold, five on the right ſide and five on the left before the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</hi> It was a ſacred utenſil of much ſpiritual uſe, therefore allud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to in that ſtately Viſion of the Prophet <hi>Zechary,</hi> cap. 4. and in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> cap. 5.1. and cap. 11.14.</p>
               <p>There needs not much be ſaid for the Hiſtory of it. Every Candleſtick had a foot or baſis on which it ſtood, which though not expreſly deſcribed; yet muſt of neceſſity be ſuppoſed. Then the ſhaft or ſtalk which aroſe ſtrait up out of the foot; and on each ſide three Branches, adorned with Bowls, Knops and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And then laſtly the ſeven Lamps on the top, <hi>viz.</hi> ſix on the top of the ſix branches, and one on the top of the ſhaft, and ſo they were ſeven in all.</p>
               <p>In theſe Lamps was the Oil, and the Light or Flame, and ſome matter for the accenſion of the Flame, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably was made of twiſted flax:<note place="margin">Vide Ainſw. on Exod. <hi>25.</hi> and on Exod. <hi>27.20.</hi> and on Lev. <hi>24.1, 2.</hi>
                  </note> to which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſeems to allude, when he ſaith, <hi>he will not quench the ſmoking flax,</hi> Matth. 12.20.</p>
               <p>The ſpiritual myſtery aimed at in it, ſeems to lye in four things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="490" facs="tcp:96313:248"/>Here was a typical ſhadow of the Church, the Miniſtry, the Word, and the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Golden Candleſtick was a Type of the Church. For this, the Lord himſelf is his own Interpreter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. <hi>the myſtery of the ſeven Stars which thou ſaweſt in my right hand, and the ſeven Golden Candleſticks; the ſeven Stars are the Angels of the ſeven Churches, and the ſeven Candleſticks are the ſeven Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But wherein doth the Golden Candleſtick repreſent the Church?</p>
               <p>I ſhall but inſtance in four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The end and uſe of the Church is to give Light, and to hold forth the Truth, as the Candleſtick gave Light, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. <hi>among whom ye ſhine as Lights in the world.</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15. <hi>the Church of God, the Pillar and Ground of the Truth;</hi> the Pillar to hold it forth, and to which it is faſtened, as an Edict to be known of all men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The matter of the Church. As the Candleſtick was of Gold: ſo the matter of the Church is Saints: therefore Churches are called <hi>Golden Candleſticks,</hi> not Braſs or Loaden Candleſticks, nor gilded Candleſticks, but Golden Candleſticks— not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and unfound and ſcandalous perſons, but Saints, viſible Saints.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Diſcipline of the Church. For there were Golden Snuffers belonging to theſe Golden Candleſticks, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.38. <hi>and the Tongs thereof, and the Snuff diſhes thereof ſhall be of pure Gold:</hi> and <hi>Exod.</hi> 37.23. <hi>he made his ſeven Lamps, and his Snuffers, and his Snuff-diſhes of pure Gold.</hi> As theſe Golden Snuffers did cut off the Snuff of the Candle: ſo Diſcipline and Cenſures cut off corruption and corrupt members.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Union and Diſtinction of Churches. There were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Branches all out of one Shaft. And ſeven Lamps: therefore diſtinct; but all growing upon one Shaft, and therefore one: ſo all Churches depend upon the ſame Chriſt, upon the ſame Head, and they are all guided by the ſame Rule, the ſame Word, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the ſame Spirit of Chriſt. <hi>Vid. Anſw. in loc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe Golden Candleſticks in the Temple were a Type of the Miniſtry in the Church: ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. <hi>the ſeven Stars</hi> that
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:96313:248"/>
ſhine in the tops of the Candleſticks <hi>are the Angels of the ſeven Churches.</hi> For as the Candleſtick doth ſupport the Lamp and the Light, ſo doth the Church the Miniſtry: and as the Lamp or Candle ſhines in the Candleſtick, ſo doth the Miniſtry in the Church. A Church without a Miniſter, is a Candleſtick without a Light. <hi>John is called a burning and a ſhining Light,</hi> Joh. 5.37. and ſo all Miniſters are, or ought to be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe Golden Candleſticks typified alſo the Light of the Word, with which the Miniſtry ſhines; and the Scripture is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a <hi>Lamp and a Candle,</hi> Pſal. 119.105. <hi>to a Light ſhining in a dark place,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.19. <hi>to Gold, and fine Gold,</hi> Pſal. 19.10. which makes the alluſion yet more full; for theſe were Golden Candleſticks: ſo the Word is Gold, yea more precious then Gold.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe Golden Candleſticks typified alſo the Spirit of God: for this the Text is expreſs— <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.5. <hi>and there were ſeven Lamps of Fire burning before the Throne, which are the ſeven Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of God.</hi> That this is meant of the Holy Ghoſt, the third perſon of the Trinity, appears by this; that <hi>John</hi> prays ſon <hi>Grace and Peace from the ſeven Spirits of God,</hi> Rev. 1.4. but it had been impious to have prayed to any created Spirit for them. But why is the Holy Ghoſt myſtically expreſſed in ſuch a phraſe, the ſeven Spirits of God? Both in alluſion to the number of Candleſticks, which were ſeven, in <hi>Johns</hi> Viſion, Rev. 1.12. and in alluſion to the ſeven Lamps that were on the top of each Candleſtick in the Temple: and alſo to ſignifie the variety &amp; perfection his of Gifts and Graces, and Operations in the Church, and in the hearts of his people: for ſeven is a number of perfection.</p>
               <p>But you may ſee the the analogy more fully in four parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lamps of the Candleſtick did ſhine and give Light: ſo the Holy Ghoſt is a Spirit of Light and Illumination, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lamps were fed with Oil, <hi>they ſhall prepare Oil-Olive beaten for the Lamps,</hi> Exod. 27.20. Now this Oil is the Spirit, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.1. <hi>Acts.</hi> 10.38. <hi>bow God anointed Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>with
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:96313:249"/>
the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> fitly compared to Oil, for the excellent nature of it: it is of a ſoftening and an healing nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe ſacred Lamps were ever burning and never went out. The Inſtitution was that they ſhould burn before the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; ſo the phraſe is, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27.20. <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.3. <hi>it ſhall be a Statute for ever throughout your Generations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a queſtion here whether the Lamps in the Temple did burn both night and day, or only by night.</p>
               <p>Some think there was need of them in the day time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Windows of the Temple were fifteen cubits high from the ground: for they were over the ſide-chambers. Others think they were lighted only from evening to morning; becauſe the phraſe is, <hi>He ſhall order it from evening to morning,</hi> Exod. 27.21. <hi>and when</hi> Aaron <hi>lighteth the Lamps at even,</hi> Exod. 30.7. And in <hi>Abijams</hi> Speech, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.11. <hi>the Candleſtick of Gold with the Lamps thereof to burn every evening.</hi> But yet it was a perpetual Light in the fit time and ſeaſon for it. They had therefore two ſorts of ſacred and perpetual Fire belonging to the Temple; the Fire of the Altar, (and this was never to go out at all, of which you have formerly heard;) and the Fire of the Golden Lamps, which was perpetual, at leaſt in the ſeaſon of it, that is, every night: and they were lighted probably from the Fire that was upon the Altar.</p>
               <p>And ſo it is with the Spirit of God in the hearts of his people. This is a Lamp that never goes out. The fooliſh Virgins indeed their Lamps were gone out, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. but in the wiſe it was not ſo. There is no falling from Grace: The true Believer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall away totally and finally.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The dreſſing and trimming of the Lamps ſignifyed thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivings of the work of the Spirit in the hearts of his people, when it begins, or is in danger to decay and decline: for the Prieſts were to light the Lamps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſee <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.2, 3, 4. the ſame thing alſo in <hi>Exod.</hi> 27.20. Hence is that expreſſion, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Before the Lamp of God went out in the Temple of the Lord,</hi> he had that appearance of God towards break of day. The Prieſts were wont, if they found any Lamps out, or burning dimly, to light them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:96313:249"/>
they did not leave it to be always dark. This teacheth us both the Lords Goodneſs and our Duty: For Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.20. <hi>he will not quench the ſmoaking flax:</hi> and ſo we ſhould <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>ſtir up,</hi> like a fire that is going out, <hi>the Gifts that are in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo Church-diſcipline and mortification are taught us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.7. <hi>then all thoſe Virgins aroſe and trimmed their Lamps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee ſomething of the myſtery of theſe Golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks in the Sanctuary: how the Church, the Miniſtry, the Word and the Spirit was ſhadowed forth thereby.</p>
               <p>As to the Uſe; you ſee here the riſe, and withal the evil of the Popiſh Superſtition of Lights and Candles in their Churches. This is an Old Teſtament Ordinance: it is to dig <hi>Moſes</hi> out of his Grave, and to deny Jeſus Chriſt. Yet their having Wax-can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles is a ſwerving from the Moſaical Law, which they pretend and ſeem to imitate. For Hony, as it was forbidden in their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Offerings made by Fire, <hi>Lev.</hi> 2.11. and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wax which belongeth to it: So we do not find that ever they did uſe Wax-candles to burn in the Sanctuary; but only Lights and Lamps of Oil.</p>
               <p>But as to the preſſing and improving theſe things in a more practical way. It is a copious and fruitful Subject: let me only repeat and re-inculcate the four general heads of things before-mentioned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Learn to prize and ſee the worth and excellency of Church-ſociety. It is no vile thing which the Lord was pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent and teach by ſo many glorious Types of old. As by <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, by the Temple, by the Golden Candleſtick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in Church-eſtate; look well to the matter of the Church, that they be Golden-Candleſticks. And when in it, look to the exerciſe of Diſcipline: a Church without the vigorous exerciſe of Diſcipline, is a Candleſtick without Snuffers: let not the Golden Snuffers be loſt or laid aſide, which by divine Inſtitution belong to the Golden Candleſtick.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Prize the Miniſtry. They are Lights, they are the Stars
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:96313:250"/>
that ſhine in the tops of theſe Candleſticks. A dark Miniſtry was the Evening Star that uſhered in the night of Popery and Antichriſt into the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. <hi>ult.</hi> compared with <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Much more prize the Word. This is the Sun in the Church, the great Light ſhining in a dark place. If thy Lamp be not lighted here, all the Light that is in thee is but Darkneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Above all labour to find the Spirit burning and working in your hearts, that you may experience the whole myſtery of this Type. The Spirit in the Word, and in the Miniſtry of it in the Church; the Spirit enlightening, and like Oil mollifying and healing the Soul, abiding there, and reviving his own work there: and remember your own Duty alſo in this thing: look to the trimming of your Lamps, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.7.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Get freſh ſupplies of Oil, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.7, 8. this is to dreſs your Lamps. This was <hi>Davids</hi> Faith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.10. <hi>I ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with freſh Oil.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is the Fountain, and the Holy Ghoſt the immediate Diſpenſer of it, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.12. and thence you are to fetch your freſh ſupplies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Stir up that which you have, as well as take in new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Stir up the Gift that is in thee,</hi> Revelat. 3.2. <hi>ſtrengthen the things that remain and are ready to dye:</hi> ſtir up thy ſelf to lay hold on God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Snuff the Wick, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.38. mortifie corruption, cut off that ſuperfluity of naughtineſs, <hi>James</hi> 1.23. this muſt be your frequent and daily work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Golden Table of Shew-bread, this was another of the holy Veſſels in the Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtory of it you have in <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 24. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> made but one, but <hi>Solomon</hi> made ten Tables, and placed them in the Temple, five on the right ſide, and five on the left, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.8.</p>
               <p>The matter of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Table was Shittim-wood; the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions two cubits in length, a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and an half the height thereof, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.23. A cubit is about a foot and an half of our meaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="495" facs="tcp:96313:250"/>It was overlaid with pure Gold, and a Crown of Gold was made round about, <hi>v.</hi> 24. There was alſo a Border round about, with a Golden Crown; and four Rings of Gold in the four corners of it to put in the Staves to carry it. Moreover there were ſeveral other Veſſels belonging to it, <hi>viz.</hi> Diſhes, Spoons, Covers and Bowls, all of pure Gold. <hi>v.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>The uſe was of it was to ſet the Bread thereon, <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſet upon the Table Shew-bread before me alway.</hi> Which is explained more fully in <hi>Lev.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 5. to the 10. <hi>Thou ſhalt take fine Flower, and bake twelve Cakes or Loaves thereof. Two tenth Deals ſhall be in one Cake, or two Omers,</hi> Exod. 16.16. that is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Quarts of our meaſure. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſet them in two rows, ſix on a row upon the pure Table before the Lord,</hi> ver. 6. of <hi>Levit.</hi> 24. <hi>and a diſh of Incenſe upon each row,</hi> ver. 7. This is the ſum of the Hiſtory of this Ordinance.</p>
               <p>In the Explication whereof, the uſe of the Table being to ſet the Bread and the Incenſe thereon, and there being ſeveral my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical and ſignificant actions ordained about the Bread and the Incenſe, we muſt inquire into them all, and not conſider the Table alone, but with reference to its uſe, and to the Bread and Incenſe, and the ſacred actions about them.</p>
               <p>There was a threefold myſtery in this Type.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Shew-bread was a Type of the Churh, which was ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified before in other reſpects by the Golden Candleſtick, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Light that ſhines there; and now in other reſpects by the Shew-bread.</p>
               <p>The analogy to this appears in four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that as many Grains make up one Loaf: ſo many Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers make up one Church; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. <hi>for we being many, are one Bread and one Body; for we are all partakers of that one Bread.</hi> One perſon is not a Church— how few and how ſmall a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Church may be reduced unto, we need not here diſpute: In <hi>Noahs</hi> time they were reduced to 8 perſons. The firſt Church, and the beginning and foundation of the Church in all after times was, when God himſelf preached the Goſpel to our firſt Parents in Paradiſe, and then <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> and their Seed were the
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:96313:251"/>
Church of God. There muſt be divers, there muſt be more then one to make up a Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The analogy appears in the number; for as there were twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo there were twelve Loaves. Theſe twelve Tribes were often and divers ways repreſented: as by the twelve Stones in the Breſt-plate of the High Prieſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.21. and by the twelve Stones which <hi>Joſhua</hi> did pitch in <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> and the other twelve which he took out of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and pitched them in <hi>Gilgal,</hi> for a memorial of the 12 Tribes paſſing thorough, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 4.9, 20. ſo <hi>Canaan</hi> was divided into twelve parts, that people coming of twelve Patriarchs; to which anſwers the twelve Apoſtles of the New Teſtament; and the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is built upon thoſe twelve Foundations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.14. ſo in theſe twelve Loaves there is the like myſtery; they repreſented both the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New-Teſtament-Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe Loaves were to ſtand before the Lord all the week upon the Golden Table. This was the chief action about them, and which holds forth the principal ſcope of the Inſtitution; therefore called <hi>Panis facierum</hi> or <hi>Propoſitionis, Matth.</hi> 12.4. which our Tranſlators have fitly rendred <hi>Shew-bread.</hi> The Apoſtles phraſe is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the meaning is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.6. <hi>thou ſhalt ſet them upon the pure Table before the Lord.</hi> This ſignified his continual eye and care over his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; they are never out of his ſight, never out of mind: his eye and his thoughts are continually upon them, from one end of the week to another; <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.16. <hi>behold I have graven thee upon the Palms of mine Hands, and thy Walls are continually before me.</hi> Though he ſeems to forſake and forget them, yet he remembers them ſtill; <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. <hi>for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill; therefore my Bowels are troubled for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. There is Frankincenſe ſet upon the Loaves, and offered up for a memorial before the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24 7. This ſpeaks the Lords remembrance of them with acceptance; for the Incenſe made a ſweet ſmell, a ſavour of reſt. A man may remember a thing with hatred and abhorrence; but the Lords remembrance of his people is with deareſt affection, with everlaſting loving
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:96313:251"/>
kindneſs; he hath a precious remembrance of them. Theſe twelve Loaves, the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are by Faith in Chriſt a ſweet odour to him; as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. And as the Lords eye is over upon them: ſo ſhould theirs be to the Lord, and that continually. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.1, 2. As the Lord ſaith of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.10. <hi>they do always behold the Face of my Father which is in Heaven:</hi> ſo the Saints even here below, they ſhould ſet the Lord alway before them. And this is Happineſs and Heaven begun, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.8. <hi>happy are thy Men, happy are thy Servants which ſtand continually before thee, and that hear thy Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> The Lords eye upon them, in a way of conſtant care and love: and their eye upon him, in a way of continual depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. This is a bleſſed condition.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the firſt myſtery of the Shew-bread, how it was a Type of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond myſtery of the Shew-bread is the Food and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Proviſion that is in the Church of God; that is, Chriſt in the Word and Ordinances. The Word is compared to Bread, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.11. Falſe Doctrine to leavened or ſowred Bread, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.12. It hath the properties of Bread, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.15. <hi>Bread which ſtrengtheneth mans heart.</hi> ver. 16. <hi>the ſtaff of Bread.</hi> This Bread is Chriſt: <hi>He is the Bread of Life,</hi> as Joh. 6.48. Chriſt is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified alſo by the Manna, and the Golden Pot thereof reſerved in the Holy of Holies. But ſome diſtinguiſh the myſtery of theſe two Types thus.</p>
               <p>That the Manna in the Oracle was the Type of Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, this Bread upon the Table in the Sanctuary was a Type of Chriſt doctrinal, or Chriſt in the Word opened and applied to hungry Souls. The analogy will appear further in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were to ſet the Shew-bread upon the Golden Table in the Sanctuary every Sabbath, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.8. <hi>Every Sabbath ſhall he ſet it in order before the Lord continually;</hi> that is, in the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, which was a Type of the Church. This then ſpeaks thus much; That the Miniſters of the Goſpel are to ſet Chriſt the Bread of Life as it were upon the Table every Lords day. There
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:96313:252"/>
is and ought to be a weekly proviſion of this Food in the Houſe of God every Sabbath. As every week there was new Bread, ſo Chriſt is to be afreſh held forth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Prieſts were to feed upon this all the week after; <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.9. <hi>And it ſhall be</hi> Aarons <hi>and his Sons, and they ſhall eat it in the holy place:</hi> ſo in the Church, they that hear the Word and have Chriſt preached and held forth therein, ſhould live all the week long upon the Proviſion that is made upon the Sabbath. Then the Bread is ſet before Lord; but in the week time it is eaten. It is a great neglect when the Bread is not eaten; when the Word is not digeſted, meditated, fed upon. But people think it is enough to come to ſome good Meeting, and there to hear the Word: But do you eat it and feed upon it all the week? do you meditate and ruminate upon it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. None but the Prieſts were to eat the Shew-bread; <hi>It ſhall be</hi> Aarons <hi>and his Sons, and they ſhall eat it:</hi> Lev. 24.9. though in an extraordinary caſe others might: as when <hi>David</hi> and his Men did, to ſave their Lives in hunger, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.6. which Chriſt allows and juſtifies, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.3, 4. for ceremonial Rules muſt give place to Moral. God will have mercy rather then Sacrifice. But the ordinary Rule was, none but Prieſts were to eat the Shew-bread. And who are ſpiritual Prieſts under the Goſpel? All Believers, they are a royal Prieſthood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.</p>
               <p>This then teacheth us, that none but Believers have a right unto Chriſt and to the Promiſes, and do or can feed upon him. Unbelievers do but intrude and uſurp that which is none of theirs, when they challenge a part in him. They are but Dogs that ſnatch at Childrens Bread.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is the Prieſts that ſet this Bread in the Sanctuary, and they eat it. We may here conſider Prieſts as Miniſters: for the Levitical Miniſtry was a Type of the Goſpel-Miniſtry. And ſo the Inſtruction here is this; That the Prieſts ſhould feed and live themſelves upon the ſame Chriſt, and the ſame Truths they preach to others. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Take heed unto thy ſelf, and unto thy Doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelf, and them that hear thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="499" facs="tcp:96313:252"/>5. There was Incenſe ſet upon the Bread, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.7. <hi>and thou ſhalt put pure Frakincenſe upon each row.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Incenſe was a Type of Prayer: ſo the Word and Prayer ſhould go together. The ſolemn Diſpenſation of the Word ſhould be accompanied with Prayer. <hi>Acts.</hi> 6.4. <hi>But we will give our ſelves continually to Prayer, and to the Miniſtry of the Word.</hi> It is ſaid of the Levites, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.10. <hi>they ſhall teach</hi> Jacob <hi>thy Judgments and</hi> Iſrael <hi>thy Law;</hi> they ſhall preach the Word. <hi>They ſhall put Incenſe before thee, and whole burnt Sacrifice upon thine Altar.</hi> Here is Prayer, and the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, which do ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed inſtead of the Jewiſh Sacrifices.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Chriſt thus feeding and ſuſtaining his Church gives us ſome intimation of his Kingly Office: For he is this Bread of Life by which their Lives are ſuſtained and upheld.</p>
               <p>And ſo look as the Candleſtick points eſpecially to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office, in teaching and enlightening us; and the Altar and Veſſels of Incenſe to that great work of his Prieſtly Office, mediating and interceding for us: ſo the Table of Shew-bread ſpeaks his Kingly Office, in ſuſtaining and upholding of us.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A third myſtery of the Shew-bread is this. It ſeems to have been a Sacrifice unto the Lord, namely, a Meat-offering, and conſequently all the Goſpel-myſteries of the Meat-offering do belong to the Shew-bread, as being one ſpecies or kind there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For the Rule is this in <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.7. <hi>Thou ſhalt put pure Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe upon each row, that it may be on the Bread for a memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, even an Offering made by Fire unto the Lord:</hi> and accordingly it was to be eaten, as other Fire-offerings were, by <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons in the Holy place. <hi>For it is moſt holy unto him of the Offerings of the Lord made by Fire,</hi> ver. 9. The Incenſe was burnt upon the Altar as a memorial for the Bread; or (as ſome think) an handful of the Flower whereof they were made, was burnt with the Incenſe for the whole.</p>
               <p>Now the Meat-offering did purge away Sin, as typifying the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, both his active and paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.14. <hi>purged by Sacrifice,</hi> or <hi>by Meat-offering.</hi> It ſignified alſo the Perſons and Services of the Saints, and the
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:96313:253"/>
Acceptance of both before the Lord. All which may be applied to the Shew-bread under the notion of a Meat-offering. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not here inſiſt upon theſe Conſiderations, but refer them to that place to which they do belong, namely to the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Offerings and Sacrifices, where the Meat-offering comes to be conſidered. But as to the two former notions of the Shew-bread, to improve them a little more practically; we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them both for Comfort and for Tryal.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For Comfort. As the Church is this Shew-bread, they ſtand before the Lord continually, his eye is ever upon them. Though thou art one whom Man deſpiſeth, and whom the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions abhor, as uſually the beſt of Gods people are moſt hated and leaſt beloved in the world; yet if the Lord regard thee, what though men deſpiſe thee? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. ult. <hi>I am poor and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet the Lord thinketh upon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how may I know that I am one of thoſe that are under the Eye and Care and Love of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſecond notion of the Shew-bread ſpeaks to this.</p>
               <p>Doſt thou feed upon Chriſt? Is he the Shew-bread, the Food of thy Soul? whom, as a ſpiritual Prieſt, thou doſt feed upon by Faith. Then thou art the Shew-bread in that other notion, as being continually before the Lord, under his eye of ſpecial Care and Love. And becauſe all depends upon this: let me give you a few Directions about it, ſome Directions in eating the Shew-bread, in feeding upon Chriſt in the Word.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Do not feed upon other things. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.2. <hi>Wherefore do you ſpend your Mony for that which is not Bread?</hi> It is but <hi>to feed upon Husks,</hi> Luke 15, 16. <hi>and lying Vanities that cannot profit.</hi> As if, through a Diſtemper in the Stomach, a man eats Coals, or feeds upon Aſhes, it hurts the Appetite and weakens Nature: ſo in Spirituals.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do not feed upon the Word without Chriſt in the Word: For it is not the Letter of the Word; it is not the bare Letter of the Promiſe; but Chriſt in the Promiſe that is the Food of the Soul: there be ſome that catch at the Promiſes and Benefits of Chriſt; but do not cloſe with Chriſt himſelf in the Promiſe,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:96313:253"/>
who is indeed exhibited and manifeſted therein. Therefore you ſhould labour to ſee Chriſt himſelf there, to <hi>behold his Glory as the only begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth:</hi> as <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. to ſee his fitneſs and ſuitableneſs to all the neceſſities of a poor ſinful Soul: and that he is a perſon every way fit to be the great means of our acceſs unto God; and ſo upon that account to cloſe with him as your Saviour, having ſeen who and what a one he is as revealed in the Word of Promiſe, by which we are firſt unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Perſon, and then do enjoy. Communion with him in his Benefits.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Never think that you ſeed upon Chriſt in the Promiſe a right, until you find ſtrength and nouriſhment from him. <hi>Bread ſtrengthens mans heart,</hi> Pſal. 104.15, 16. It is a lamentable thing when the Bread of life ſtrengthens not, when there is no ſtaff nor ſtay in the Promiſe; <hi>when God ſends leanneſs into mens Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But may not true Believers complain of unprofitableneſs? Yes. But ſtrength comes at laſt, if they go on to feed upon this food: Therefore that which I aim at is this; that you ſhould never ceaſe believing, and eating and feeding upon Chriſt in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ordinance, and at every opportunity, till at laſt you find ſtrength and ſpiritual nutriment unto your Souls by him.</p>

               <p>HAving ſpoken of the holy Veſſels in the Sanctuary, we are now to treat of the ſacred Furniture of the Holy of Holies, concerning which we formerly obſerved from this Text this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal propoſition.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 5. <hi>That the ſacred Furniture, or the holy Veſſels and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils belonging to the Holy of holies, were the Golden veſſels for the offering of Incenſe, and the Ark with its appurtenances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former our Tranſlators render <hi>the Golden Cenſer:</hi> the Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The difficulties upon this place are very great. Perhaps this Text may be numbered amongſt the <hi>Inſolubilia Scripturae,</hi> thoſe inſoluble knots which will never fully be unfolded in this life, and which God hath left there on purpoſe to confound the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of all the world, that no Fleſh might glory, and that he might exerciſe his people unto reverence of his Word, in thoſe things which they cannot comprehend. One ſaith of it, <hi>Suſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus eſt mihi locus iſte.</hi> I would not ſay ſo; but this I may ſay, that of all the difficult Scriptures that I have had occaſion to
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:96313:254"/>
ſearch into, this hath been one of the moſt difficult; unto my own weakneſs one of the moſt difficult.</p>
               <p>That which I would humbly offer for the interpretation of it, is only this; That the word being <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> it ſignifies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſomething belonging to Incenſe: and I know not how to tranſlate it more fitly, then by this Periphraſis; <hi>That Golden <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſil for the offering of Incenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But then the queſtion will be, what were thoſe Golden Veſſels that did ſerve to that uſe, and which of them was here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a Rule which you have often heard, and muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be remembred in the Expoſition of Scripture; That the Scripture muſt be expounded in the largeſt and moſt comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſenſe: Therefore if there were divers ſacred Veſſels of this kind, they may be all included. The Holy Ghoſt ſeems to have uſed ſuch a general expreſſion, on purpoſe to include them all: and ſo this may reconcile the different interpretations given by Expoſitors.</p>
               <p>Now there were two holy Veſſels for this uſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is thought there was a Golden Cenſer, which was laid up in the Holy of holies all the year till the Feaſt of Expiation, and that then the Prieſt went in and fetch'd it out, and offered Incenſe with it in the Holy of holies. Such a Cenſer is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by <hi>Joſephus contra Apionem, lib.</hi> 2. And though it be not ſo clearly and expreſly mentioned by <hi>Moſes;</hi> yet there ſeems to be ſome intimation of it in <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.12. Moreover it is no new thing in the Scripture, that things which are more briefly and more obſcurely hinted in the Old Teſtament, ſhould be more plainly and more expreſly delivered in the New. The two Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments, the Old and the New, looking one towards another, as the two Cherubims did over the Ark. As for inſtance, the Names of thoſe Conjurers that withſtood <hi>Moſes</hi> are not mention'd in the Hiſtory in <hi>Exodus:</hi> but we have their Names in the New Teſtament, their Names were <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.8. And the Conteſt between <hi>Michael</hi> and Satan about the Body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Propheſie of <hi>Enoch</hi> are mentioned in the Epiſtle
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:96313:255"/>
of <hi>Jude,</hi> but no where in the Old Teſtament, as is generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: though learned <hi>Junius</hi> inclines to judge the Conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Michael</hi> and Satan mentioned by <hi>Jude,</hi> is that which we have repreſented in a Viſion to <hi>Zechary</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Zechar.</hi> 3. ſee <hi>Junius</hi> his Notes on <hi>Jude</hi> and his <hi>Parallels, Append, Paral.</hi> 16. and other inſtances might be given.</p>
               <p>So this Golden Cenſer; though not ſo expreſly mentioned in the Old Teſtament; yet it is twice mentioned in the New: firſt in this Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.4. and again in <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. and there it is conjoyned with the Golden Altar. <hi>And another Angel came and ſtood at the Altar having a Golden Cenſer, and there was given unto him much Incenſe, that he ſhould offer it upon the Golden Altar.</hi> And in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.50. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.22. there is mention of Golden Cenſers in the plural number.</p>
               <p>This Golden Cenſer was a little Pan made of Gold, with a handle to it, fit to hold living coals in, whereon to put the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was alſo a Golden Altar of Incenſe in the Temple; and it is not likely that the Apoſtle would wholly omit and paſs over this ſo great an Utenſil, when he mentioneth all the reſt: Therefore that which we tranſlate the Golden Cenſer, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do interpret it as meant of this Golden Altar of Incenſe.</p>
               <p>But here a great Objection doth occur, how this is here ſaid to ſtand in the Oracle, or in the Holy of holies? for it is clear it ſtood in the Sanctuary; becauſe they were to offer Incenſe upon it every day; but they were not to enter into the Holy of holies but once only a year.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer that is commonly given is this; That it ſtood in the Sanctuary <hi>quoad ſitum;</hi> but in the Holy of holies <hi>quoad uſum,</hi> as to the place and poſition of it, it was in the Sanctuary; but yet it belonged to the Holy of holies in regard of the uſe and imployment of it: which poſſibly may be the reaſon of the alteration of the form of ſpeech <hi>ver.</hi> 4. from what was uſed <hi>v.</hi> 2. The Holy of holies had the Golden Altar of Incenſe, becauſe it had a relation to that part of the Tabernacle, though it was not ſeated in it, as the Candleſtick and Table were in the outer San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, <hi>v.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="505" facs="tcp:96313:255"/>The firſt Inſtitution of it is <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. ver. 1. to 10. And <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> made one for the Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.22. <hi>And the whole Houſe he overlaid with Gold, until he had finiſhed all the Houſe: alſo the whole Altar that was by the Oracle he overlaid with Gold.</hi> Here the Altar is ſpoken of, as having relation to the Oracle. <hi>The Altar that was by the Oracle;</hi> as in the Text, the Holy of holies had the Golden Utenſil for the Incenſe.</p>
               <p>The uſe of it was to burn Incenſe upon it. Of the Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. ver. 34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Myſtery of theſe things. Firſt as to the Altar, and then as to the Incenſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Golden Altar of Incenſe was a Type of Chriſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Interceſſion, that great work of his Prieſtly Office: as the Altar of Burnt-offering was a Type of Chriſt in regard of the other part of his Prieſtly Office, his Oblation or Satisfaction. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Golden Altar was to be ſprinkled with the Blood of the Sin-offering to make atonement once a year, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.10. <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.18. to teach us, that Chriſt intercedes in the virtue of his own Oblation, or ſacrificing of himſelf. And this makes his Interceſſion ſo prevailing and powerful with the Lord; He prays for nothing, but what he hath purchaſed by his Death: He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires nothing from the hand of Mercy, but what he hath bought and paid for at the hand of Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As no Incenſe was to be offered, or could be accepted, but upon this Altar: ſo no Prayers are acceptable to God, but through the Name and Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt: unleſs offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this Golden Altar, neither Prayers of Prieſt nor People can be accepted: without this, <hi>he that offereth Incenſe, is as if he bleſſed an Idol,</hi> as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.3.</p>
               <p>Now to unfold the Myſtery of the Incenſe.</p>
               <p>The Incenſe that was offered upon this Golden Altar, was a Type of Prayer, the Prayers both of Chriſt, and of his Saints: Both the Prayers which Chriſt offers up for the Saints, and which the Saints offer up for themſelves in his Name and Medi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ation.
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:96313:256"/>
See <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.8— <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.2. <hi>Let my Prayer be ſet forth before thee as Incenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may ſee the fulneſs of the analogy more at large in ſeven particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was made up of many choiſe Ingredients, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.34. ſo is the Spirit of Prayer as it were a compound of many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Graces: There muſt be Faith, Humility, Fervency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and indeed all the Graces of Gods Spirit are drawn forth and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in Prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are ſtrictly forbidden to make another Perſume of their own heads like unto it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.37, 38. ſo we are not to make uſe of any other Interceſſors or Mediators but Chriſt only. And in like manner for men to make Prayers in the way of ſtinted Liturgies, though there be many of the ſame Ingredients in the Maſs-book, that is, good expreſſions for the matter of them, and words and notions that are found in the Scripture; yet this being not the Incenſe that is inſtituted, it is not, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accepted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe Ingredients whereof the Incenſe was made were to be beaten very ſmall into fine Powder, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.36. This teacheth us that Contrition of heart that ought to be in Prayer, how the Soul is to be contrite and broken as it were all to pieces by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling meditations of its own unworthineſs when it appears before the Lord in Prayer. Theſe are the Prayers that God regards, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. The Sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit: <hi>a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe</hi>— Iſai. 57.15. <hi>I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</hi> If a man come with his heart whole and not broken, this is to offer the Incenſe unbeaten, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Incenſe was to be ſet on fire, and ſo the ſmoke went up before the Throne. <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.7, 8. This ſpeaks that holy Fervency in Prayer.</p>
               <p>There ſhould be ardent affections inflamed by the Fire of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5, 16. <hi>the effectual fervent Prayer of a righteous
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:96313:256"/>

               <p n="5">5. This burning of Incenſe was a Service performed every day, morning and evening. <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.7.8. This teacheth us that Prayer ſhould be a daily work, morning and evening. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> tells us of his praying in the morning. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>My Voice ſhalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord, in the morning will I direct my Prayer unto thee, and will look up.</hi> And alſo in the evening, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.2. <hi>The lifting up of my hands as the evening Sacrifice.</hi> Yea both he and <hi>Daniel</hi> uſed to pray thrice a day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.17. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Anna</hi> departed not from the Temple, but ſerved God with Faſtings and Prayers night and day, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.37. and we are commanded to pray continually, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.17— <hi>Praying always with all Prayer,</hi> Epheſ, 6.18. that is, every day in the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Prayer. And <hi>Paul</hi> mentions his praying day and night, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. which may well be underſtood of evening and morning. See alſo 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.5. and <hi>Act.</hi> 26.7.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The time of burning the Incenſe was when they dreſſed and lighted the Lamps of the Sanctuary, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.7, 8. This teacheth us the conjunction of the Word and Prayer in the Church, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.10— <hi>Acts</hi> 6.4. <hi>But we will give our ſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to Prayer, and to the Miniſtry of the Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The Smoke of the Incenſe aſcended with a ſweet and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant ſmell into the Holy of holies before the Mercy ſeat, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.4. <hi>and the Smoke of the Incenſe which came with the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Saints aſcended up before God out of the Angels hand.</hi> It went up out of the Angels hand. This ſpeaks, that our Prayers come up before the Lord into his holy place, even into Heaven, before the Throne of Grace, with acceptance through the Merits and Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.10. <hi>thy Prayers are come up for a memorial before God.</hi> Hence that expreſſion, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. <hi>hear thou in Heaven thy dwelling place.</hi> For the Holy of holies was a Type of Heaven; and the Mercy-ſeat is that Throne of Grace where the Lord is ſaid to dwell between the Cherubims, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.1. It ſpeaks alſo that God returns gracious anſwers to them; as it is <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.13. <hi>the Lord anſwered the Angel that
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:96313:257"/>
talked with me with good and comfortable words.</hi> Sometimes there is a gracious terribleneſs in them; I mean a mixture of Mercy and Terror in the Lords anſwers and returns of Prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. ver. 5. <hi>by terrible things in righteouſneſs wilt thou anſwer us, O God of our Salvation.</hi> Thus <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.5. when the Angel caſt down the Cenſer upon the earth, <hi>there were voices, and thunderings, and lightenings, and an earthquake.</hi> The Lord uttering his voice as it were from the Holy of holies in dreadful diſpenſations of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in the ſeven Trumpets: it is from the Prayers of Saints, that thoſe dreadful Trumpets were ſounded.</p>
               <p>But one of the ſtrangeſt inſtances of the Lords anſwering Prayer by ſtrange and ſeemingly contrary Providences, is that of the Turks, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. It is agreed by all Interpreters, that the ſixth Trumpet is the Turk. But did ever any Chriſtian pray for the coming of the Turk into Chriſtendom? No, but yet they came; and the Voice from the four Horns of this Golden Altar of Incenſe uſher'd them in, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.13. The meaning is this; the ſtrange Power of God did anſwer the Prayers of his people this way, it is the Prayers of Gods people that turns the wheel of Providence as it were, and brings about all the great and mighty revolutions in the courſe thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Of Comfort in five or ſix particulars.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine of Chriſts Interceſſion (which is the myſtery of this Golden Cenſer and Altar of Incenſe) is full of Comfort to poor praying Souls; thou haſt an High Prieſt which offereth up thy Prayers, and they are made acceptable through his Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>This affords Comfort, let thy condition be what it will.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If thou find thy ſelf unskilful in making application of that part of Chriſts Prieſtly Office, which conſiſteth in his Death; yet thou maiſt look up to him to ſpeak a good word for thy Soul: this work is doing ſtill, though the former be done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In caſe of new ſins committed after Grace received, here is this Comfort; that as Satan puts in new Accuſations againſt thy Soul: ſo Chriſt puts in new Anſwers, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>if any man ſin, we have an Advocate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="509" facs="tcp:96313:257"/>3. Many an one is much troubled with fears of future back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings; but Chriſt prays that thy Faith fail not: he prays not only that we ſhould come home and be converted, but alſo <hi>that we be preſerved unto his heavenly Kingdom.</hi> Joh. 17.15. He prays <hi>that we ſhould be kept from the evil.</hi> Hence ſometimes Believers are kept from being tempted: But if they be tempted, they are either kept from falling by temptations; or if they fall, from ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their falls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Suppoſe you meet with troubles, oppoſitions and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the world. Let the world ſpeak evil of us; yet Chriſt ſpeaks well of us, or rather for us, to his Father; and then what need we fear. See <hi>Iſai.</hi> 51.7, 8.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thy Prayers are full of weakneſſes and imperfections: but the Prayers of Jeſus Chriſt have no weakneſs and imperfection going along with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how may I know that Chriſt prays for me?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou maiſt know it by two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If thou haſt a heart to pray for thy ſelf; thy Prayers are the eccho of his Interceſſion: if Chriſt hath taught thee to pray for thy ſelf, Chriſt intercedes and prays in Heaven for thee. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hath the Lord taught thee to prize the Prayer and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt for thee? if ſo, it is a ſign he is interced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for thee. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. This alſo makes againſt the Papiſts, who plead for Mediators of Interceſſion (though not of Satisfaction) beſide Chriſt. This cannot be: for his Interceſſion is founded in his Satisfaction; the Scripture makes him the only Mediator of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. It is true, the Saints do pray, or intercede for one another: but yet they are not Mediators; becauſe it is not their own Incenſe, nor their own Blood; but it is his Incenſe, it is his Blood that makes their Prayers effectual. They do not pray in their own name, but in his: but he prays in his own name, by the merit of his own Blood.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It had many glorious appertainances that related to it, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other veſſels belonging to this, as the Cherubims, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The place of it was the Holy of holies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Solomon,</hi> though he made all other things new in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet he did not make a new Ark; but only introduced the ſame which <hi>Moſes</hi> had made, with great ſolemnity into the Oracle, the place which he had prepared for it. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.7.</p>
               <p>Whatever changes and varieties there may be in other things whereby God diſpenſeth himſelf unto and amongſt mankind: other utenſils may be made new; there may be new Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, new Adminiſtrations; but there is no new Chriſt. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver look for any new or further Adminiſtration in this reſpect: as there is no new God, ſo there is no new Chriſt: but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi> Heb. 13. It is a blind and blaſphemous deluſion to ſpeak of Chriſt as an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, that is to paſs away when the Saints have paſſed under it for a while.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In that the Providences about it were very great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and full of teaching and inſtruction.</p>
               <p>The Ark of God led them through the Wilderneſs. We are to follow the Guidance of Chriſt through the world. It was carried with Bars; ſo is Chriſt upon the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, from one place to another. As the Levites did carry the Ark; ſo Preachers
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:96313:258"/>
may be ſaid to carry Chriſt, to bear his Name among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: ſo <hi>Paul Act.</hi> 9.15.</p>
               <p>Many great things were done by it. <hi>Jordan</hi> was divided by it: ſo by Chriſt all obſtacles are removed out of the way. The Walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> fell by it: ſo by Chriſts coming the ſtrong holds of Satans Kingdom are caſt down. It was the downfall of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon:</hi> So is Chriſt of Satan and Idolatry. While the Ark was amongſt the Philiſtines they were plagued; but <hi>Obed-Edom</hi> was bleſſed while it was at his Houſe: ſo Chriſt in the Goſpel to ſome brings wrath being refuſed, to others Salvation. <hi>Eli</hi> and his Daughter died when the Ark was taken, and the Bethſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites rejoyced exceedingly when they ſaw it: ſo the preſence of Chriſt brings comfort, but his abſence grief and ſorrow. The Bethſhemites were puniſhed for prying into the Ark. It is a dangerous thing to ſearch into inſcrutable Myſteries. Be wiſe unto ſobriety. The Ark after many travels was brought at laſt to a place of reſt in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple: ſo Chriſt after many wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſome journies on Earth was at length taken up into Heaven, a place of reſt where he ſits at the right hand of God.</p>
               <p>But as to this glorious Utenſil it ſelf, we may obſerve theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Ark was the Throne of God on which he did appear ſitting on his Throne of Grace and Glory, and from whence he ſpake and gave forth Anſwers and Oracles. Hence we read of <hi>a Throne of Grace,</hi> Heh. 4. ult. This Throne of Grace is that Mercy-ſeat that covered the Ark on which God ſate, and where he is ſaid to dwell between the Cherubims, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.1.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here he gave upon ſpecial occaſions viſible appearances of his Glory. This is that <hi>Shechinah</hi> which the Jewiſh Rabbins ſpeak of. And they have it from the Scriptures and the Prophets. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. laſt. and <hi>cap.</hi> 9. and 10. The Glory of the Lord is ſaid to appear, and to remove, and depart away by little and little. There was ſtill leſs and leſs of God among them till he was quite gone. So <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.2.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence the Lord ſpake with audible voice, and gave forth his anſwers: ſo he promiſed to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 25.22. ſo <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:96313:259"/>
                  <hi>ult.</hi> The myſtery of all which is this, that God is to be ſeen in Chriſt, and that he ſpeaks and reveals his mind to us only in and through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Mercy-ſeat which was upon the Ark, was a Type of the paſſive Obedience and Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt for our ſins, whom God hath ſet forth to be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>a propitiation</hi>— 1 Joh. 2.2. <hi>he is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Law, which was within the Ark, is the active Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>thy Law is within my heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Golden Pot of Manna is Chriſt in the Word, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.48, 49, 50, 51. He is the true Manna, the true Bread of life.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod that budded is the Miniſtry, bleſſed with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs for the good of Souls, <hi>Numb.</hi> 17.10. this was reſerved before the Teſtimony, for a token againſt the Rebels.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Cherubims upon the Ark are the Angels miniſtring to the Lord, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. they are there deſcribed, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 6.2. they look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Ark; they pry into the myſteries of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. held forth by the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10. The myſtery of the Incarnation of the Son of God being above their comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and their Subjection to Chriſt as Mediator being not included originally within the Law of their Creation: therefore they learn this myſtery from the Church.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Chariot of the Cherubims, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.16. is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Providence. The Throne of God is deſcribed with Wheels, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.16. the Throne hath Wheels, and 10.9. Some think the other two Cherubims that were beſide the Ark, ſtood not upon the Golden Pavement of the Oracle, but upon a Chariot and Wheels; from whence that expreſſion, [the Chariot of the Cherubims]. However they are ſo repreſented in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Viſion, <hi>cap.</hi> 1. there be not only living creatures, that is, Angels; but Wheels, that is, motions, turnings, revolutions of Providence.</p>
               <p>Now to open theſe things a little more particularly in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and order wherein they lie before us in the Text, we muſt obſerve that there are ſix particulars here enumerated as parts or appertainances to the Ark.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="513" facs="tcp:96313:259"/>1. <hi>The Ark of the Covenant was overlaid round about with Gold</hi>] that is, this ſacred Cheſt it ſelf (for the Cover is mentioned after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.)

                  <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>Overlaid with Gold</hi>] for the matter was Shittim Wood. This was an intimation of the ſpiritual excellency and preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Myſtery hereby adumbrated.</p>

                  <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>A Crown of Gold round about</hi>] for Ornament and Glory.</p>

Theſe were alſo put with it in the Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.8. to teach this people that if they did provoke the Lord, he might yet remove the Ark of his Preſence from them.</p>
               <p>It is called the Ark of the Covenant, becauſe the two Tables of the Covenant which God made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> were put therein. <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.16. <hi>And thou ſhalt put into the Ark the Teſtimony which I ſhall give thee.</hi> Of which further afterward.</p>
               <p>It was a Type of Chriſt in regard of his active Obedience, fulfilling the Covenant for us. <hi>Thy Law is within my heart,</hi> Pſal. 40.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In it was the Golden Pot that had Manna</hi>] of which <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. Of this we ſpake among the Occaſional Types.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherein</hi>] There be ſeveral interpretations of this word. Some refer it to the more remote antecedent, the Tabernacle: ſome to the Ark, conceiving it was in the Ark till <hi>Solomons</hi> time; for then there was nothing in it, but the Tables of the Covenant. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8.9.</p>
               <p>Or <hi>in which</hi>] may be interpreted in a larger ſignification: as if he had ſaid, About which, or belonging to which: For theſe things were appertainances to the Ark, and did belong to it; as being laid up by it or before it, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.34. <hi>Numb.</hi> 17.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod that budded, of which <hi>Numb.</hi> 17. A Type of the Goſpel-Miniſtry, bleſſed with ſucceſs for the good of Sou s:
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:96313:260"/>
as alſo a pledge of Gods Preſence with it, and the Levitical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry during that Adminiſtration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Rod brought forth fruit, <hi>v.</hi> 8. And the Almond tree is a fruitful tree.

               <p n="2">2. The Almond tree is very early in its Fruit. Some Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts write, that it is the firſt of all Trees that buds. Miniſters ſhould be fruitful to God betimes, as <hi>Jerem.</hi> 1.5. and <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>he ſees an Almond tree the ſooneſt ripe.

               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. This Rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> is a Rod of Government: ſo the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture often ſpeaks of a Rod for a Rod of Authority and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.2. <hi>he will ſend the Rod of his Strength out of</hi> Sion— <hi>ſhall I come unto you with a Rod?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. There is a Rod of Government and Diſcipline. For a Miniſter to lay this aſide, is the way to be popular, and to get applauſe amongſt the largeſt ſort of Profeſſors for a time: But if he make conſcience to exerciſe the Diſcipline of Chriſt in his Congregation, he ſhall be hated and laden with reproaches and revilings; <hi>he ſhall hear the defaming of many on every ſide, that will ſay, Report and we will report it. But the Lord will be with him as a mighty terrible one.</hi> Jer. 20.10, 11. <hi>If thou diſtinguiſh between the precious and the vile, thou ſhalt be as my month.</hi> Jer. 15.19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This Rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> is laid up before the Ark in the Holy of holies. An emblem of the neerneſs of faithful Miniſters unto God, which is both their Duty and their Priviledge. They

               <p n="5">5. And over it the Cherubims of Glory.

They were pictures of young men, though with four Faces; the Face of a Man, of a Lyon, of an Ox, and of a flying Eagle. They had alſo Wings, in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6. ſix Wings: For <hi>with two they covered their Faces, with two they covered their Feet,</hi> thoſe parts of the body which are the feat of ſhame, <hi>and with two they did fly.</hi> There were two of them over the Ark; and <hi>Solomon</hi> made two more, which ſtood with their Feet upon the ground, or upon the Chariot of the Cherubims, as ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.18. the Text calleth them Cherubims of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or glorious Cherubims.</p>
               <p>As to the Myſtery of them, I find in Scripture phraſe three things ſignified thereby.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Angels of Heaven who are compared to Chariots and fiery Chariots, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.17. <hi>the Chariots of God are twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, even thouſands of Angels:</hi> which ſuits with that expreſſion of the Chariot of the Cherubims in the Oracle, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.18. and with that of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. <hi>the Angels bow down their heads to pry into the myſteries of the Goſpel,</hi>
                  <pb n="516" facs="tcp:96313:261"/>
alluding to the poſture of the Cherubims over the Ark.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Kings and Magiſtrates are called Cherubims in Scripture: ſo it is ſpoken of the King of <hi>Tyre, Ezek.</hi> 28.14. <hi>Thou art the anointed Cherub that covereth; and I have ſet thee ſo: thou waſt upon the holy Mountain of God.</hi> It ſpeaks forth both their Dignity and Duty. The Magiſtrate is to protect the true Religion and the Worſhip of God, as the Cherubims did cover the Ark.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Miniſters are called Cherubims: ſo in <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. thoſe four living Wights are nothing elſe but four Cherubims, as you will clearly ſee, if you compare that with <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Viſion, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. But theſe Cherubims or four living Wights in the Revelation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be interpreted concerning the Angels in Heaven: becauſe they are ſaid to be redeemed by the Lambs Blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.8, 9. which the Angels in Heaven were not. And moreover the four living Wights are expreſly diſtinguiſhed from the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ver. 11. therefore it muſt needs be meant of a lower ſort of Angels, the Angels of the Churches; that is, the Officers and Miniſters of the Church, who ſhould be men of Angelick Spirits for induſtry, and zeal, and vigilancy in the Lords work.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſixth and laſt part of the Ark here mentioned, is the Mercy ſeat. <hi>The Cherubims of Glory overſhadowing the Mercy ſeat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Mercy-ſeat was the Cover of the Ark, of which, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.17. The Hebrew word for it is <hi>Capporeth,</hi> from <hi>Caphar,</hi> to cover with pitch, and in another Conjugation, to expiate, atone, appeaſe. It implyeth a merciful covering of our ſins.</p>
               <p>The Septuagint call it ſometimes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a propitiatory covering, and ſometimes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Lid or covering laid on. The Apoſtle applies it to the Blood of Chriſt, and the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made thereby to the Juſtice of God for our ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. See the Glory of the viſible Church, and of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God there. For all theſe glorious things are in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the Holy of holies there. And therefore your ſhould ſee God himſelf there, and hear his voice, though not viſibly and audibly, but ſpiritually; yet really and powerfully and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſpeaking to the heart. You ſhould ſee theſe things by the
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:96313:261"/>
eye of Faith. When you come to a Meeting, though the World revile and call them Conventicles, you ſhould ſee a guard of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Cherubims round about you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. See the fulneſs of ſupply and ſpiritual relief that is in Jeſus Chriſt, in the Goſpel, for poor loſt Souls.</p>
               <p>Here is ſomething to anſwer all their caſes and neceſſities: here is God appearing and ſpeaking in Chriſt: here is paſſive and active Obedience: here is the Word, the Miniſtry, the Guard of Angels, the workings of Providence for the Churches good.</p>
               <p>There be two things which an enlightned Conſcience needs, and cries for.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I cannot keep the Law; I want a perfect legal Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to appear before God in.</p>
               <p>Therefore Chriſt hath done it: Here is the Law kept in this bleſſed Ark of the Covenant: <hi>He hath fulfilled all Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But I want a Propitiation for the ſins that have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>But therefore here is a Mercy-ſeat upon the Ark, a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Covering, in the paſſive Obedience of Jeſus Chriſt, whereby he hath not only kept the Law, but ſatisfied for our breaking of it. Draw neer to God in the faith and meditation of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>

            <head>An Advertiſement to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THe obſerving Reader will remember, that in the method propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Author, the Legal Miniſtry ſhould have come in the next place to be treated of: But the Author in his courſe of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing handled this Head before that; which alteration of his firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned method, and thus tranſpoſing theſe two heads of the Legal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and the Legal Feſtivals, is by himſelf accounted for in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance on that of the Legal Miniſtry; and therefore no more ſhall be ſaid of it.</p>
            <p>The Reader will alſo doubtleſs obſerve, his Entrance on this ſubject of the Legal Feſtivals to be more abrupt then in the reſt; of which this account may be given, That on this head the Authors Notes which he left behind him were leſs perfect then on any of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and thence, as it coſt more labour to bring them to what is here preſented: ſo the judicious Reader will perhaps diſcern a difference between his Diſcourſes on this and on the other heads, as not being ſpun with an even thred. And we have therefore been neceſſitated to uſe a greater liberty here, then we allowed our ſelves elſewhere, to inſert in their propereſt places, as neer as we could, ſundry notions which we found noted down in the Authors broken Papers relating to this ſubject, ſome whereof perhaps were not his own, yea it may be not according to his Judgment, (though we do not know of any ſuch inſerted) but only noted down by him as they came into his mind, or as he met with them in reading, to be better conſidered of at further leiſure: For it is certain it was his manner thus to do. Moreover, we do find many imperfect hints of Notions amongſt his Papers, which we could not find where to inſert, nor indeed, as to ſome of them, well tell what to make of them, or how to expreſs them as the Author deſigned; and therefore they are loſt with him.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, we may advertiſe the Reader, that we find the Author had thoughts of re-aſſuming and going over this whole head of the Legal Feſtivals again, in ſomewhat another method, the firſt rude linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereof were thus drawn by himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> he deſigned firſt a
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:96313:262"/>
brief delineation of the whole, and when inſtituted; namely their Feaſts, (to wit, the Paſſover, Pentecoſt, the Feaſt of Tabernacles, the Feaſt of Trumpets, and the great Day of Expiation) their New Moons and their Sabbaths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, the ſeventh day of the week, the ſeventh year, amd the fiftieth year. Next he deſigned to go over them all again, and ſhew how they made up a rude draught, or a dark ſhadow of better things; and here he would have made the firſt Inſtitution to be his Text for the ſeveral Heads and for the Sabbath the <hi>12, 13, 14, 15.</hi> verſes of the fifth of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> becauſe the typical Reaſon is there annexed to the Command. And in the laſt place he intended to have ſpoken more fully to the unwarrantableneſs of Popiſh Holidays, and Muſick.</p>
            <p>And indeed he had many years before written two brief Diſcourſes on that Argument, the main Materials whereof we ſuppoſe he would have brought in here, perhaps with ſome conſiderable Additions: and therefore we have for the affinity of the matter to this head of the Jewiſh Feſtivals ſubjoined, as an Appendix thoſe two Diſcourſes, as they were found amongst the Authors Papers. Farewell.</p>

            <p>Obſ. 1. <hi>That the Jewiſh Holy days were of three ſorts, and may be referred to three heads,</hi> viz. <hi>Feaſts, New Moons, and Sabbaths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Diſtribution of them doth frequently occur in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, in other places, as well as in this Text, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.4. <hi>I build an Houſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, for the Burnt-offerings on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and on the New Moons, and on the ſolemn Feaſts of the Lord our God</hi> — Ezek. 45.17. <hi>And it ſhall be the Princes part to give Burnt-offerings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in the Feaſts, and in the New Moons, and in the Sabbaths, even in all the ſolemnities of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, that is, in their appointed or ſolemn Aſſemblies.

               <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.11, <hi>I will alſo cauſe all her mirth to ceaſe, her Feaſt-days, her New Moons, and her Sabbaths, even every holy Aſſembly of hers.</hi> The firſt word is <hi>Feaſts,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Hebrew <hi>moyed,</hi> ſet times, becauſe they came at ſet times of the year. This is meant of their annual Feſtivals, which were in number five. The three principal were, the Feaſt of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and the Feaſt of <hi>Tabernacles;</hi> which continued, the two former each of them ſeven days, the laſt for eight days together; and the firſt day and the laſt day of them were holy Convocations, wherein they were to do no ſervile work, but to be wholly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant for the Word and Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>The firſt mention of them is in <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.14-17. They are more largely ſpoken to in the 23. chap. of <hi>Leviticus;</hi> and again in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. and briefly recapitulated and ſummed up in ver. 16. Theſe were the principal: becauſe then all the males were to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and therefore theſe three are ſo often mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together.</p>
            <p>There were alſo two more, the <hi>Feaſt of Trumpets,</hi> and the <hi>Feaſt of Expiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are five general Rules obſervable concerning all theſe yearly Feaſts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they were all to be celebrated at the place the Lord their God ſhould chooſe, which was <hi>Jeruſalem, Exod.</hi> 23.14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.16. That which we are to learn therein is this, <hi>that there is a Church-worſhip.</hi> There are ſome Ordinances of Gods Worſhip which are not to be enjoyed but in Church-ſociety. As there is a perſonal and family-worſhip: ſo there is publick or Church-worſhip; of this kind is the Lords Supper. If this be not an Ordinance of publick Worſhip under the Goſpel, there is none: therefore to carry it to private perſons upon their death-beds, as the Papiſts doe, is unwarrantable and ſuperſtitious.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is to be obſerved, that they were all in the Summer time, and not in Winter: for the Paſſover was upon the fourteenth day of the firſt month, Pentecoſt was ſeven weeks after, and the Feaſt of Tabernacles was upon the fifteenth day of the ſeventh month. Hence is that expreſſion, <hi>Acts.</hi> 27.9. Sailing is now
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:96313:264"/>
dangerous, becauſe the Feaſt was now already paſt, that is, the Feaſt of Tabernacles.</p>
            <p>The Inſtruction we are here to learn is this, namely, to ſee the tenderneſs of God towards his people, even as to the outward man. As he will have Mercy rather then Sacrifice: ſo he orders the matters of Sacrifice and Worſhip with tenderneſs and mercy even to the bodies of his people: yea the Spirit of God vouchſafes to dwell in their very Bodies, as well as in their Souls, and he preſerves the duſt thereof as precious reliques in the treaſures of his Providence, and will gather thoſe diſperſed atoms, and bring them forth again, and raiſe them up to everlaſting life. How great is his Goodneſs to us!</p>
            <p>It ſhews there is a Duty incumbent upon us in reference to our Bodies; and how great a ſin it is in men to wrong and hurt their bodies, when the Lord himſelf is tender of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They were not to come empty handed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.16, 17. true Religion is bountiful: Duties of Worſhip are to be accompanied with duties of mercy and bounty: ſo upon the Chriſtian Sabbath, there ſhould be Collections for the poor, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2.</p>
            <p>Hypocriſie divides theſe, it is willing to ſerve God, but in the cheapeſt way: hypocrites are all for a cheap Religion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whereas there was danger of Invaſion by their Enemies, when all the Males were abſent; the Lord ſecures them by a promiſe of ſpecial Protection. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.24. <hi>Neither ſhall any man deſire thy Land, when thou ſhalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God, thrice in the year.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Learn here, that while we are in our Duty, God will take care of our Safety— the way of Duty is the way of Safety. When the Church of the Jews was gone from God, and had crucified the Lord of Life, this protecting Providence forſook them. For at the Paſſover it was, that the <hi>Romans</hi> took and deſtroyed <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> This Ordinance which was at firſt, and ever after, a means of ſafety to them, the Lord now makes it a ſnare to bring them all together as it were into a pound, that the <hi>Romans</hi> might take them and cut them off. But while they abode with God in
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:96313:264"/>
purity of Worſhip and Obedience, he abode with them in his protecting Providence.</p>
            <p>This ſhould be a great encouragement to us in the Work and Worſhip of God, to run all hazards, and to fear no colours, but be reſolute in the diſcarge and performance of Duty. The Lord is with us in ſuch a caſe, and then who can be againſt us?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Theſe Feaſts (as to their end and uſe) were both comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morative of former Benefits, and alſo prefigurative of future. It may be ſaid ſo of other holy times and holy things alſo; but it holds eminently true concerning theſe three ſolemn anniverſary Feaſts.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe yearly Feaſts was <hi>the Paſſover,</hi> which began upon the fifteenth day of the firſt month, anſwering chiefly to our <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Inſtitution of it is in the 12th chap. of <hi>Exodus.</hi> There were three things which were the peculiar obſervations of this Feaſt, which do diſtinguiſh it from the reſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The killing and eating of <hi>the Paſchal Lamb</hi> (with the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies thereto belonging) which was <hi>upon the fourteenth day of the firſt month at even.</hi> Exod. 12. v. 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The putting away of Leaven, and eating unleavened Bread for ſeven days, that is, from the fifteenth to the one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of that month, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. ver. 15. Hence it hath its denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>the Feaſt of unleavened Bread,</hi> from this Ceremony: as it is called the Feaſt of the Paſſover from the Paſchal Lamb that was eaten over night. <hi>See of this before on</hi> Lev. 7.37. <hi>upon the Meat-offering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Sheaf of firſt Fruits was waved upon the morrow after the Paſſover, that is, upon the ſixteenth day of the firſt month. But of this there will be occaſion to ſpeak further in the next Feaſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the ſpecial Obſervations and appertainances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this Feaſt, beſides thoſe general Rules beforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that do concern them all.</p>
            <p>Now for the end and uſe of this Feaſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It was the Commemoration of their Deliverance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:96313:265"/>
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and from the deſtroying Angel there, which was the occaſion of the firſt Inſtitution of the Paſſover. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.26, 27. And unleavened Bread was made uſe of to this end, becauſe their departure was ſo haſty, that they had not time to leaven their Bread. Hence <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.3. unleavened Bread is called the Bread of tribulation, becauſe they did eat it when they were in great tribulation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was a preſiguration of our ſpiritual Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, who is <hi>the true Lamb of God,</hi> Joh. 1.29. and <hi>a Lamb ſtain from the Foundation of the World,</hi> Rev. 13.8. and who was actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſlain in the fulneſs of time, at this very ſeaſon, namely, <hi>at the Paſſover,</hi> as you find it recorded in the four Evangeliſts.</p>
            <p>It ſhadowed forth Chriſt in five reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Paſchal Lamb it ſelf held forth Jeſus Chriſt in ſundry of the perſonal qualifications ſitting him for his Office: therefore Chriſt is ſo often called <hi>a Lamb, Joh.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.6.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Paſchal Lamb was to be <hi>a Lamb without blemiſh,</hi> Exod. 12.5. ſo Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>Ye are redeemed with the precious Blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot, who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifeſt in theſe laſt times for you.</hi> There was not the leaſt ſpot of ſin on Chriſt, either in his heart, or in his life and practice; <hi>he knew no ſin,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lamb was to be <hi>a male, Exod.</hi> 12.5. which is the more excellent and perfect ſex. This excellency might ſhadow forth the perfect excellency and abſolute perfection of Chriſt: ſo Chriſt was of the male ſex, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9.6. to us <hi>a Son</hi> is born.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Lamb is a meek and patient creature: therefore Chriſt is compared to a Lamb in regard of his Meekneſs and Patience; there was no reſiſtance, there was nothing in him but ſilent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Hand and Juſtice of his Father in his Sufferings. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.7. This appeared alſo in the whole courſe of his life: he had many provocations, but did put all up: he wrought no miracle to the deſtruction of men, as ſome of his Servants have done: but it appeared moſt eminently in his Sufferings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The killing and dreſſing of the, Lamb, held forth the Death
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:96313:265"/>
and Sufferings of Chriſt; of which we may note four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Lamb was to be taken, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.5. and ſo was Jeſus Chriſt arreſted, as it were, and ſeized upon by divine Juſtice, to which the Officers and Souldiers were but inferiour Inſtruments and Executioners.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was ſlain, ver. 6. and ſo was Chriſt, though now he is alive, and lives for evermore; yet ſlain he was, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.6. I ſaw a Lamb as it had been ſlain, and <hi>v.</hi> 13. ſlain before the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, in regard of Gods Decree, and the efficacy of his Death, which was accepted for the Saints of old, and doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill to be accepted for Believers, the Virtue of his Death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides ſtill.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Lamb was roſted in the fire, not raw, nor ſodden, v. 9. This ſignifies the ſcorching heat and fierceneſs of the fiery Wrath of God upon Chriſt when he bare our ſins: He did not ſave us without ſuffering, nor by an eaſie way of ſuffering. <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.4. <hi>He bent his bow like an enemy, he ſtood with his right hand as an adverſary: he poured out his fury like fire.</hi> Thoſe expreſſions may be here applied to Gods dealing with Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Not a bone of it was to be broken, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.46. This is applied unto Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.33, 36. <hi>not a bone of him was broken.</hi> It was ſaid of the Paſchal Lamb, and it is quoted as ſpoken of Chriſt: for the Lamb was Chriſt typically, and in a ſhadow. There was an over-ruling Providence of God in it, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance and accompliſhment might anſwer the promiſe in the Type.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The time of it ſhadowed forth Chriſts Sufferings. There was a remarkable analogy in the circumſtances of time, and this in four reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that the Lamb was to be a year old, not the firſt day or week, but at a fit age was the Lamb to be taken up: ſo Chriſt at a fit age, in the beſt and fitteſt time; ſo far we may ſafely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this circumſtance from that of the Apoſtle, <hi>In due time, Rom.</hi> 5.6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that the Lamb was to be taken the tenth day: but not ſlain till the fourteenth day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.6. ſo Chriſt entred into his
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:96313:266"/>
publick Miniſtry the thirtieth year of his life, which is the tenth thrice told; and ſuffered not till the four and thirtieth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.23. he was neer about thirty years old when baptized. And in the Goſpel of <hi>John</hi> there are four Paſſovers mentioned, at the fourth whereof he ſuffered, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.27. <hi>in the midſt of the week.</hi> The week is ſeven prophetical days, ſeven years, the midſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is three years and an half. Moreover he was born on the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the ſeventh month: for that was the day of the Feaſt of Tabernacles; from whence to the Paſſover, which was in the firſt month, is half a year.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Lamb was to be ſlain on the fourteenth day of the firſt month, the time when they came out of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> ſo Chriſt died at the very ſame time of the year, at the Feaſt of the Paſſover: So that the time did look backward to their typical Redemption out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and forward to their ſpiritual Redemption by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. It is true, it is called the preparation day, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.31. but that is thought to be, becauſe the Jews had a corrupt cuſtome, when two great Feaſts came ſo neer together, to put off the former a day longer. But Chriſt obſerved and fulfilled the time appointed in the Inſtitution.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It was to be ſlain in the evening, or (as the Margin has it) between the two evenings: for every day had two evenings, namely, the evening of the day, which began at three a clock in the afternoon; and the evening of the night, which began at Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.26, 27. The Lord gave them ſo large a time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had many other Services and Sacrifices to offer. See <hi>Ainſworth in loc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46, 50. he ſuffered death about the hour of three a clock, and then the evening began: for the ſixth hour of the day is that which we call twelve a clock, the ninth hour is that which we call three a clock in the afternoon; for the Jews reckoned their hours from morning to evening, and not as we do, from midday to midnight.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee how the time of the Paſſover ſhewed forth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers circumſtances of the time of Chriſts Sufferings.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Blood of the Lamb ſhadowed forth the Blood of Chriſt. See the analogy in four things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="527" facs="tcp:96313:266"/>1. The Blood of the ſlain Lamb was not to be ſpilt upon the ground, or trodden under foot, but kept in a Baſin, as a precious thing, <hi>v.</hi> 22. What that typified, we may gather from that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. <hi>they have trodden under foot the Blood of the Covenant.</hi> This was to hold forth the preciouſneſs of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; it is called <hi>precious Blood,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. Unbelief rejects and ſpills this Blood, and makes it to be ſhed in vain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was to be ſprinkled upon the lintel and poſts of their doors with a bunch of Hyſſop, <hi>v.</hi> 22. This ſhadowed forth the ſprinkling of Chriſts Blood upon the Souls of his people, that is, the effectual application of it by the Promiſe. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.15. <hi>He ſhall ſprinkle many Nations,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>the ſprinkling of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was to be ſprinkled with a bunch of Hyſſop. This intimates the means of the application of the Blood of Chriſt, which are the Promiſes, and Ordinances, and Faith, and the Spirit of Chriſt in them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Blood of the Paſchal Lamb it made atonement for them, that is, typically: ſo Chriſts Blood doth it really. Nothing we can do can expiate the leaſt ſin: but there is atoning virtue in this Blood; he hath expiated our ſins, and made Satisfaction for our offenſes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hence the deſtroying Angel paſſed over them, <hi>v.</hi> 23. and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſpared when the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were cut off: ſo Believers are ſaved through the Blood of Chriſt ſprinkled upon their Conſciences, when Unbelievers are cut off and periſh eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>the Blood of Chriſt ſpeaks better things then the Blood of</hi> Abel.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee how the Blood of the Paſchal Lamb typified the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Their eating the Lamb ſignified our ſpiritual ſeeding upon Chriſt by Faith, eſpecially in the Sacrament of the Supper. We eat Chriſt ſpiritually by Faith, and ſacramentally in the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>The manner of eating was very ſignificant to hold forth the manner of receiving Chriſt in the Supper, not <hi>unworthily,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. but in due order, as 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.13.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="528" facs="tcp:96313:267"/>1. They were to do it ſtanding, with their ſtaves in their hands, their ſhooes on their feet, and their loins girt, which was a poſture of readineſs for action and motion, which ſeems to have been a peculiar circumſtance of that firſt Paſſover; but it was very ſignificant, ſhewing how we ought to behave our ſelves in the <hi>Egypt</hi> of this world, and of a natural condition, and of Anti-chriſtian bondage, that we ſhould be upon a poſture of motion and action, beſtirring our ſelves to get out of it. <hi>Gird up the Loins of your minds,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.13. ſaith the Apoſtle, that is, be at Chriſts diſpoſe, be ready to follow his Call, <hi>to follow the Lamb whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever he goeth,</hi> Rev. 14.4. Let us up and be going, for we have a great journey before us, and <hi>this is not our reſt,</hi> Mich. 2.11. <hi>here we have no continuing City, but ſeek one to come.</hi> Hebr. 13.14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They were to eat it with ſowr or bitter Herbs. Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was a Man of Sorrows, and muſt be fed upon with bitter and dolorous remembrance of our ſins, and of his Sufferings for them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28, 31. the grief we have put him to, ſhould be matter of grief to us. Repentance and godly ſorrow muſt go along with the exerciſe of Faith. And as Chriſt ſuffered before he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Glory: ſo all that will follow him, muſt bear the Croſs before they can wear the Crown. We cannot reign with him except we ſuffer with him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They muſt eat it without Leaven, and have no Leaven for ſeven days, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Leaven is of an infecting, ſowring, ſpreading nature. It is put for falſe Doctrine, <hi>Beware of the Leaven of the Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> Matth. 16.6, 12. and the Apoſtle interprets it as ſignifying alſo Hypocriſie, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 8. <hi>Purge out the old Leaven, and let us keep the Feaſt with the unleavened Bread of Sincerity and Truth.</hi> So Chriſt interprets it to his Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Beware ye of the Leaven of the Phariſees, which is Hypocriſie.</hi> And the Apoſtle. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. applies it in particular to the ſowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſwelling luſt of malice. <hi>Let us keep the Feaſt not with old Leaven, naither with the Leaven of Malice and Wickedneſs</hi>—</p>
            <p>As they having eaten the Paſſover did preſently abſtain from all Leaven for ſeven days together: ſo we having once laid hold
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:96313:267"/>
on Chriſt, and fed upon him by Faith, muſt put away the old leaven of ſin and corruption, purging our hearts as they did their houſes of it, not a day, but ſeven days, <hi>ſerving the Lord in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs all the days of our lives.</hi> Thus we are to keep the Feaſt under the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The whole Lamb was to be eaten, and none of it left, <hi>ver.</hi> 9.10. ſo by Faith we muſt receive whole Chriſt, and all his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Is Chriſt divided?</hi> every Believer hath whole Chriſt to himſelf. Some are willing to feed upon Chriſt for pardon, and to eat that part of the Lamb: but to feed upon Chriſt for holineſs and mortification, this they deſire not.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It was to be eaten by the whole Family, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, and 4. and if the Family were too little, they were to call in others: this ſignified both the communion and enlargement of the Church.</p>
            <p>It ſignified the ſpiritual communion of the Church, as being one Body, one ſpiritual Family, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12, 13. the whole Church of Chriſt muſt eat and feed upon Chriſt jointly, as well as ſeverally and perſonally, and exerciſe a ſpiritual and viſible communion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. It ſignified alſo the enlargement of the Church, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of others, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.23. <hi>compel them to come in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But no uncircumciſed perſon might eat thereof, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. ſo now, none uncircumciſed in the fleſh, no unbaptized perſon, and none uncircumciſed in heart, none apparently unregenerate may be received to the Lords Supper. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.7, 9. which ſpeaks of New Teſtament days in Old Teſtament phraſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Their ſecond Feaſt was that of Penticoſt,</hi> ſo called in the New Teſtament, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.1. from the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the fiftieth, becauſe it was kept fifty days after the Paſſover.</p>
            <p>It is called <hi>the Feaſt of Weeks,</hi> becauſe they were to reckon ſeven weeks from the morrow after the Paſſover, and then they were to offer to the Lord their two Wave-loaves, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.17. there was a threefold myſtery in this Feaſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To teſtifie their Gratitude and Thankfulneſs unto God for the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and for the Harveſt of the Fruits of the earth: therefore they were to preſent the firſt Fruits thereof to him at this Feaſt. Hence it is called <hi>the Feaſt of Harveſt,</hi> Exod.
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:96313:268"/>
23.16. and <hi>the Feaſt of Firſt Fruits,</hi> Numb. 28.26. and <hi>the Feaſt of Weeks of the firſt Fruits of the Wheat-harveſt.</hi> Exod. 34.22. As in the former the firſt Fruits of their <hi>Barley-harveſt,</hi> ſo in this the firſt Fruits of their <hi>Wheat-harveſt</hi> muſt be offered to God. This was as it were the compleating of that.</p>
            <p>There are four Inſtructions to be learned from hence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God muſt be acknowledged in outward mercies, in the Fruits of the Earth; we muſt pay him the Rent of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, as our great Landlord, and that is all the Rent that he requires. He is in giving ſo liberal, that he gives us all things richly to enjoy; but in taking ſo ſparing, that he requires but a Sheaf for the whole Harveſt: (For, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.17. it is he that giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us Rain and fruitful ſeaſons, filling our hearts with food and gladneſs:) and would it not be ſtrange ingratitude to receive from God whole harveſts of his Benefits, and return nothing, not not ſo much as one Sheaf to him?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Inſtruction is this; this Feaſt inſtructs when it is that the Soul becomes truly fruitful and thankful, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg God indeed, namely, when the Blood of Ghriſt hath been ſprinkled upon the Soul, when his Death hath been applied and not before. For they were firſt to eat the Paſſover, and ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin that Feaſt; and then upon the morrow after the Paſſover they were to offer the firſt Fruits of Barley, and from thence to reckon fifty days to the Feaſt of Weeks; ſo that their firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of their thankfulneſs to God for the Fruits of the earth was immediately after they had killed and eaten the Paſſover.</p>
            <p>It is that which many complain of, a carnal, dead, inſenſible, unthankful frame of heart; but you ſee here both the cauſe of it, and the cure and remedy againſt it. The Soul will come to own God, to dedicate it ſelf and all it hath unto God, when firſt ſprinkled with the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt the Lamb of God, but not till then.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They were to begin theſe their acknowledgments of God on the ſixteenth day of the firſt month, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.10, 11. for then Barley was ripe in thoſe climates, at another ſeaſon then in theſe Northern Countries. Then they were to begin their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:96313:268"/>
of God, they were not to delay their thankfulneſs till they had gotten in their whole Harveſt; but they muſt bring the firſt unto God. It is a lovely thing to ſee men acquaint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with God betimes, to give him the firſt ripe Fruits: and it is but equal <hi>reddere illi prima, qui nobis dedit omnia;</hi> that we ſhould render the firſt unto him who giveth all unto us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As they begun betimes, ſo they were to proceed; as in their Harveſt, ſo in their Thankfulneſs: for they offered firſt but a Wave-ſheaf of Barly, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. but now two Wave-loaves of Wheat; then but one Lamb, now ſeven Lambs, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.18. far greater Offerings then the former. To teach us, that a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Thankfulneſs and Fruitfulneſs ſhould be increaſing, till at laſt he be made perfect. We ſhould not ſit down in ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beginnings, but go forward and make continual progreſs in the ways of God: as their time goes on, ſo ſhould their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
            <p>The greater Gods Bleſſings are to us, the greater muſt our Thankfulneſs be to him; as he doth increaſe his Benefits, ſo ſhould we augment and increaſe our Obedience. A good Note (ſaith one writing upon this Feaſt) for all them to think of to whom God hath extended a more liberal hand then to their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Many riſe up early, go to bed late, and part from their beloved ſleep; yet fare hardly, eat brown Bread (as we ſay) and drink the Water of Affliction. Is thy condition better then theirs? art thou fed with the fineſt of the Wheat inſtead of their Barly? Remember then, that <hi>to whom much is given, of him ſhall be requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much,</hi> Luk. 12.48. ſeven Lambs for their one, and for their one Sheaf two Loaves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond end and myſtery of this Feaſt of Pentecoſt was in reference to the giving of the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> That this was one part of the myſtery of this Feaſt of Pentecoſt the time it ſelf ſpeaks, with other circumſtances: For <hi>they came out of</hi> Egypt <hi>to ſerve the Lord, and to keep a Feaſt to him in the Wilderneſs.</hi> Exod 5.1, 3. And they had the Law firſt given to them at this time of the year: for it was in the third month after they came out of <hi>Egypt. Exod.</hi> 19.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="532" facs="tcp:96313:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>Now they came out at the Paſſover, which was on the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the firſt month; from whence, if you reckon fifty days from the ſixteenth day of the firſt month, it will bring you to the ſixth day of the third month, in which they received the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the memorial whereof was celebrated by this Feaſt.</p>
            <p>For God to give his Law and Ordinances to a people, and to reveal his Mind and make known his Will to them, it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable mercy to be kept always in precious remembrance, and to be celebrated with everlaſting thankfulneſs; eſpecially for them who before were tyed to the cruel Laws of Egyptian Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and Taskmaſters, now to receive not only a Law of their own, but a Law from Heaven, a Law from God, was an ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mercy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third myſtery of Pentecoſt, was the pouring forth of the Spirit at this time, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4. as at this time God gave the Law under the Old Teſtament: ſo it pointed us to the time when he would give the firſt fruits of his Spirit under the New; which he poured forth upon the Apoſtles, who thereupon went forth to preach the Goſpel, and to gather that which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets before had ſown, reaping fruit unto eternal life, and bring Wheat of God into his Garner.</p>
            <p>As at this Feaſt he gave the Law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo at the ſame time he gave his Spirit by Jeſus Chriſt. To teach us, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel we receive the Spirit of Chriſt to enable us to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> fulfil the Law, and do the Will of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Vnto this Feaſt there was added another Precept, of leaving for the poor, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.22. teaching them, that with their Sacrifices to God, they ſhould joyn love to their brethren: and that as Gods hand opened to them, ſo their hands ſhould be opened to the poor and needy. But this was a general rule in all the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Feaſts, not to appear before the Lord empty-handed, as was obſerved before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third of their ſolemn Feſtivals was <hi>the Feaſt of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,</hi> which began upon the fifteenth day of the ſeventh month, the fifteenth day of <hi>September;</hi> and it laſted eight days, the firſt
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:96313:269"/>
and laſt whereof were holy Convocations, or days ſanctified and ſet apart for publik Worſhip.</p>
            <p>The principal Rite and Ceremony of this Feaſt (to diſtinguiſh it from the reſt) was their dwelling in Booths, from whence it hath its demomination, and is called the Feaſt of Booths, or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, as you have the deſcription of it at large in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.34. to the end.</p>
            <p>There was a threefold myſtery in this Feaſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To put them in mind of their dwelling in Tents when they travelled through the Wilderneſs into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> they dwelled forty years in Tents, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.42, 43. <hi>that your Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may know that I made the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to dwell in Booths, when I brought them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt. That was one thing, to keep the memorial of that great Diſpenſation of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards their Fore-fathers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond myſtery was this, to inſtruct them that they were but Pilgrims and Strangers here below, Sojourners as it were in a ſtrange Land, paſſing through it to their own Country, towards their own home. <hi>I am a ſtranger with thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) and a Sojourner, as all my Fathers were,</hi> Pſal. 39.12.</p>
            <p>This Ceremony was ſtrangely neglected and forgotten by them in their obſervation of this Feaſt for about a thouſand years together, till they were taught by their deportation into <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> to keep it better, as you find in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.13. to the end, <hi>they went forth and fetched Olive-branches,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to make Booths, as it is written,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For ſince the days of</hi> Joſhua <hi>the ſon of</hi> Nun, <hi>unto that day, had not the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>done ſo:</hi> a ſtrange omiſſion. Some underſtand it only of the frame of Heart wherewith they kept it, and not of this external Rite; but it may include both. Now they made Booths; they had learnt now that they were but Sojourners indeed while they were here below, and that the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was not the true reſt, nor their own Country; but that they were to ſeek and look for another, that is an heavenly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. <hi>ariſe and depart, for this is not your reſt, for it is polluted.</hi> Mich. 2.10.</p>
            <p>Here then is a ſecond myſtery of this Feaſt of Tabernacles, to
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:96313:270"/>
put them in mind that they were but Sojourners while they were here, and were to ſeek and expect another Countrey, an everlaſting abode and fixed habitation in the Heavens.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Feaſt of Tabernacles pointed them to the time when God himſelf would come to tabernacle and pitch his Tent amongſt men. Therefore the expreſſion is in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>and the Word was made Fleſh, and he came and did pitch his Tent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us,</hi> dwelled as in a Tent or Tabernacle amongſt us. Wherein he refers to this great Inſtitution and Feaſt of Tents or Tabernacles: and many other circumſtances of this Feaſt fall in ſuitably to this ſcope and great Goſpel-myſtery of it. For it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagined that this Feaſt ſhould have no relation to Jeſus Chriſt, eſpecially it being ſo great a Feaſt, greater in ſome reſpects then either of the two former, for it laſted eight days, whereas the Feaſt of the Paſſover was but ſeven; the eighth day pointing us to his Circumciſion, as the firſt to his Birth: and it had a more wonderful and myſterious courſe of Sacrifices appointed for it, then the other Feaſts had; as you may ſee, <hi>Numb.</hi> 29. from <hi>ver.</hi> 12. to the 40. there muſt be thirteen Bullocks offered the firſt day, and but twelve the ſecond day, and but eleven the third day, and ſo to the end of the Feaſt every day leſs and leſs, till upon the laſt day no more but only one; which is thought to ſhadow forth the ceſſation and evanition at laſt of all the legal Sacrifices: it intimates that all thoſe legal external Sacrifices were to ceaſe at laſt. That Covenant and that Adminiſtration of it waxing old, and growing weaker and weaker, and decaying, till it be vaniſhed quite away, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.13.</p>
            <p>Moreover this Feaſt had two other Feaſts previous to it in the ſame month, the Feaſt of Trumpets on the firſt day of the ſeventh month, and the Feaſt of Expiation on the tenth day of it; and then follows, after ſuch preparations and introductions, this great Feaſt of Tabernacles from the fifteenth to the two and twentieth.</p>
            <p>They had alſo a cuſtome (as the Jewiſh Writers report) of ſinging certain Songs and Hymns of Praiſe to God when they were preparing and making theſe Booths and Tabernacles, one whereof was the 118. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ver. 25. Hoſanna <hi>ſave now I beſeech
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:96313:270"/>
thee, O Lord,</hi> and they would ſay, <hi>necte Hoſannam,</hi> fold or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the <hi>Hoſanna</hi> Inſomuch that the whole Feaſt, the Booths, Tabernacles, and the Feaſt and all came in proceſs of time to be called <hi>Hoſanna's.</hi> Now this the people apply in their Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Songs of Praiſe to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. which though it was done at another time of the year; yet, as the people in thoſe Acclamations ſeem to allude to the manner and cuſtom at the Feaſt of Tabernacles: ſo they do aſcribe it to the Meſſiah, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna to the Son of</hi> David. And well they might, for the Birth of Chriſt was at the Feaſt of Tabernacles: Chriſt did then taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle in the fleſh. Moreover, at this Feaſt of Tabernacles was <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple dedicated, and the Ark ſolemnly introduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, 2, <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.2, 3, 7. which Temple was a Type of Chriſts humane nature, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19, 21. I know it is contrary to the common account, to place the Birth of Chriſt here, upon the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the ſeventh month. But conſider theſe arguments for it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From this Feaſt of Tabernacles, which muſt needs point to ſome principal thing concerning the Meſſiah, as well as the two former Feaſts did. And in how many particulars it ſuits this of his coming to tabernacle in our fleſh, you have heard.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the ſpace of time that our Saviour did converſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us here upon earth.</p>
            <p>As to his private life, we find, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.23. that he was baptized, and entred upon his Miniſtry as he began to be about thirty years old.</p>
            <p>His publick Miniſtry was about three years and an half: for we read of four Paſſovers in the Goſpels at which he was preſent, at the laſt whereof he ſuffered.</p>
            <p>And the Angel faith to <hi>Daniel,</hi> that <hi>in the midſt of the week the Meſſiah ſhall be cut off,</hi> Dan. 9.27. which is meant of a propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal week containing ſeven years, the half wherreof is three years and an half.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we read in all the Evangeliſts, that the Death of Chriſt was at the Paſſover in the firſt month.</p>
            <p>Now if we reckon three years and an half from thence, it
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:96313:271"/>
will carry us to the month of <hi>September</hi> for his Baptiſm: ſo as the whole ſpace and time of his converſing here below was about three and thirty years and an half: his private life about thirty years, his publick Miniſtry about three years and an half; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the common account, inſtead of half a year, makes but a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a year between the Feaſt of his Nativity and <hi>Eaſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all which it appears that the time of his Birth was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the ſeventh month at the Feaſt of Tabernacles: and for the further confirmation thereof, there be ſundry paſſages and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in the ſacred Hiſtory of his Birth, by which it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that it could not be in the tenth month, as is commonly ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his taxing all World, and ordering them to repair to their own Cities for that end, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.1. it is not likely that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror would enjoyn all his Subjects to travel in the depth of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to their own Cities. An obſervable Providence, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for its falling out in this juncture of time. The Scepter was gone from <hi>Judah,</hi> when they were compelled by a foreign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to neglect the Feaſt of Tabernacles, and to travel to other places inſtead of going up to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore now it was full time for <hi>Shilo</hi> to appear, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Propheſie of old <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 49.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Shepherds were abroad watching and keeping their Flocks by night, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.8. but it is not probable they were ſo in the depth of Winter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>John</hi> was baptizing in <hi>Jordan</hi> at that time of the year thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years after, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.23. but it is not likely that he would chooſe out the coldeſt part of the year for that work; though thoſe Climates were hotter in the Summer then this; yet they were alſo cold in the Winter. The Winter even in thoſe Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates was but a hard time to travel in, or to watch in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.20. <hi>pray that your flight be not in the Winter.</hi> Yea, ſo cold that at the Paſſover they needed a Fire within doors, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.18. and ſurely in the depth of Winter it was much colder.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But then how aroſe this miſtake to place the Birth of Chriſt in the very midſt of Winter?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="537" facs="tcp:96313:271"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They reaſoned from that paſſage of <hi>Zacharias</hi> offering Incenſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.5-11-36. They did reaſon thus, that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was conceived at the end of <hi>September,</hi> and Chriſt ſix months after, which falls out about the end of <hi>March;</hi> from whence they reckon his Birth nine months after, towards the end of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in this whole Argumentation there is a Concatenation of manifold miſtakes, abſurdities, and incongruities, beſides many uncertainties.</p>
            <p>For 1. <hi>Zacharias</hi> was not the High Prieſt. For he was of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi>'s Courſe. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.5. But the High Prieſt was of no Courſe: for he was above all the Courſes. And <hi>Zacharias</hi> is called a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Prieſt of the Courſe of <hi>Abia;</hi> a Style too low for the High Prieſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Incenſe he offered was not the yearly Incenſe-offered on the tenth day of the ſeventh month, but the daily Incenſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Angel did not appear to him in the Holy of holies, but in the Sanctuary: for the Altar of Incenſe ſtood in the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If there were none of theſe manifeſt and palpable miſtakes in this argumentation; yet it is wholly bottomed upon many ſuppoſitions and preſumptions which are altogether uncertain, and without any ground in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>As for inſtance, it ſuppoſeth firſt, that as ſoon as <hi>Zacharias</hi> came home, after the days of his Miniſtration were ended, his Wife <hi>Elizabeth</hi> conceived. And ſecondly, that this was that year on the ſeven and twentieth of our <hi>September.</hi> And thirdly, that there was ſix months, to a day, between the Conception of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt and the Angels ſpeaking to the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> When as the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks in a greater latitude; and</p>
            <p>As to the firſt ſaith thus, <hi>after thoſe days his Wife</hi> Elizabeth <hi>conceived,</hi> Luk. 1.24. but whether it was preſently after, or a month, or two months, or three months after, he ſaith not.</p>
            <p>And as to the third, the Angel ſaith only, that it was on the ſixth month, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. and that it was the ſixth month of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Child, <hi>v.</hi> 36. but whether the beginning, or middle, or
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:96313:272"/>
end of it he leaves wholly in the dark. Whereas this Opinion makes it to be juſt at the expiring of the ſixth, and entrance of the ſeventh month.</p>
            <p>To which might be added, as a fourth groundleſs and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain preſumption, that if it were certainly known to a day what time <hi>Elizabeth</hi> conceived, yea and what day the Angel ſpake to <hi>Mary;</hi> yet the ſame uncertainty ſtill remains, how long after the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi>'s ſpeaking ſo to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> it was before the power of the moſt High came upon her, and ſhe conceived of the Holy Ghoſt: it might be ſome days or weeks after, for ought that can be proved to the contrary.</p>
            <p>And laſtly (to add yet a fifth uncertain groundleſs ſuppoſal that is preſumed and proceeded upon in this vulgar computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) if all theſe forementioned particulars were preciſely declared in the Scripture; yet what aſſurance have we that the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> went neither more nor leſs then two hundred and ſeventy days, or nine ſolar months of thirty days a month, after her Conception before the Birth of Chriſt? For though he was in all things, except ſin, made like unto us; yet it is well known, that according to the Experience of Women, and the Judgment of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, there is a conſiderable variation and latitude in the time of Womens going with Child, it being ſometimes more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſs, differing (at leaſt in different perſons) not only ſundry days, but ſometimes ſome weeks, yea months.</p>
            <p>But then the ſecond of the firſt mentioned uncertain ſuppoſals (which I caſt into this place, becauſe I would ſpeak a little more largely to it) namely, that <hi>Zacharias</hi>'s Miniſtration ended that year, preciſely on the ſeven and twentieth of <hi>September,</hi> is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonſtrable and uncertain as any of the other.</p>
            <p>For firſt, though there were four and twenty Courſes of Prieſts before the Captivity of <hi>Babylon;</hi> yet how will it be proved that there continued juſt the ſame number ever after through all the calamities, and concuſſions, and confuſions that the Jewiſh State and Worſhip underwent? how can it be proved that none of theſe four and twenty was utterly extinct before that day by Death, or Apoſtacy, or Excluſion, or ſome other way?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="539" facs="tcp:96313:272"/>And ſecondly, if that could be proved; yet how will it ever be made out that they continued in an uninterrupted order of Succeſſion, as they were diſtributed and ranged in <hi>Davids</hi> days? 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. why might not one lot, ſuppoſe that of <hi>Abijah,</hi> through ſome occurrence or other fall into the week of the lot of <hi>Hakkor,</hi> or of <hi>Jeſhua?</hi> there is no prohibition of it by God but that it might lawfully be done in ſome caſes: and though it might not; yet we find there was introduced as great and a greater variation and ſwerving from the firſt Inſtitution and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God concerning the continuance of the High Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. For it appears in the Evangeliſt to be anniverſary, at leaſt mutable, about the time of Chriſts Death, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.49, 51. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.6. when as by the Law of God it ought to have been during life unchangeable.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, if both theſe were granted, or could be as firmly proved as they are ſtrenuouſly ſuppoſed; yet we are ſtill in the dark, unleſs we can certainly and demonſtratively fix the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our reckoning of the Succeſſion of the Courſes of the Prieſts both to a year, and to a month, yea to a very day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely. But whether this Computation of the Succeſſion of the Courſes of the Prieſts muſt begin from the firſt ordaining of them in the later end of <hi>Davids</hi> Reign, or from the finiſhing and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Temple in <hi>Solomons,</hi> or from the erecting of the Altar at the firſt return from Captivity in <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Reign, or from the re-building of the Temple in the Reign of <hi>Darius,</hi> or from the cleanſing and new Dedication of it, after its Pollution and Profanation by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> of which we read in the <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi> is ſtill ſubject to endleſs undeterminable Controverſie and Diſpute.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if we could attain convincing clearneſs in all the former; yet there will ariſe a further unreſolvable Queſtion touching the Rule of the proceedure of this Computation; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether it muſt begin with the lot of <hi>Joarib,</hi> which came out firſt in <hi>Davids</hi> ordering of them, and doubtleſs at their firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring on the execution of their Attendance by courſes was the firſt, or whether it muſt begin where at the interruption it left
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:96313:273"/>
off; or whether at the courſe to which it would have fallen at the reſtauration, had no ſuch interruption intervened.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, if all theſe ſnarling intanglements were extricated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravelled and made plain; yet we are never the neerer to our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of finding out the time of <hi>Zacharias</hi> Miniſtration either as to month or year, much leſs as to the day, unleſs we could certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make out, how many years there are from the time that we begin our reckoning at, to the year of that Miniſtration of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias.</hi> But this lies involved under ſo much darkneſs and ſo many perplexities, that the moſt learned Chronologers, who have ſet themſelves with greateſt induſtry and moſt advantages to make out the year of the Birth of Chriſt, have given ſo little ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to others, that there are almoſt as many ſeveral years fixed on for it, as there are Chronologers. Some have reckoned up forty ſeveral Opinions of learned men about it, and perhaps more might be added. Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> placeth it about the three thouſand nine hundredth year of the World. Others ſeven and twenty years later. Yea ſeveral years between that and the four thouſandth are fixed on by ſeveral Chronologers. Others again go beyond the four thouſandth year, ſome one, others two, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers forty, others fifty years; yea there are that bring it down below the five thouſandth year, and ſome below the ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth, yea neer to the ſeven thouſandth year of the World.</p>
            <p>Yet muſt all theſe things which are ſo altogether uncertain, and left by God in ſuch a latitude, be punctually determined, and taken for true and certain, if the grounds of this vulgar Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning Chriſts being born on the five and twentieth of <hi>December</hi> have any ſtrength in them. A conſideration this is which doth ſufficiently ſhew the non-cogency, invalidity and utter weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that reaſoning which ſome learned men uſe from the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Prieſts to find out the time of Chriſts Nativity; a way of reaſoning it is which hath ſo little of evidence and ſtrength in it, that ſeveral learned men make uſe of it to eſtabliſh their ſeveral different Opinions in this point.</p>
            <p>Some there are that do from hence argue for the five and twentieth of <hi>December.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="541" facs="tcp:96313:273"/>Another makes uſe of the ſame way of arguing to prove that Chriſt was born on the ſixth of <hi>January.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others take the ſame courſe of arguing to caſt the Nativity of Chriſt on the later end of <hi>September</hi> or beginning of <hi>October;</hi> and there is a very learned man who uſeth the very ſame way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning to prove the Birth of Chriſt fell on the Ides, that is, on the thirteenth of <hi>November.</hi> An ingenious and elaborate way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing this muſt be confeſſed to be, in the making out of the whole Contexture whereof ſeveral Authors have ſhewn a great deal of uſeful Learning.</p>
            <p>But nevertheleſs by what hath been briefly hinted, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that there are ſo many weak parts and uncertainties throughout the frame and contexture of the argumentation, that the whole of it is rendred uncogent and unſatisfactory to one that looks for firm and ſolid footing to build his Judgment on, from ſuch ſtrength of Reaſon, and clearneſs of Evidence, as may conſtrain aſſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> See the unwarrantableneſs of the Obſervation of theſe Feſtivals amongſt Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>The Paſſover is that we commonly call <hi>Eaſter,</hi> Pentecoſt is that we call <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> and for the Feaſt of Tabernacles the Pope hath ordained <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If theſe days were ſhadows of good things to come, and that the Body is of Chriſt, (as the Text is expreſs) then now the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is come, theſe ſhadows are ceaſed and vaniſhed away; the Subſtance being come, the ſhadow muſt needs fly away and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</p>
            <p>Moreover, theſe Feaſts, theſe days and times, ſince the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, have not been attended and accompanied with the Bleſſing of God, but rather with the viſible tokens and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his diſlike and diſpleaſure. For as there is a Bleſſing of God upon his Ordinances: ſo he is wonted to imprint his Curſe upon the Inventions of men. <hi>Eaſter</hi> was the firſt Ball of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that ever was amongſt Chriſtians; the Eaſtern and the Weſtern Churches contending ſharply about the time of it for above two hundred years together: ſo that <hi>Victor</hi> the Biſhop
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:96313:274"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi> excommunicated many Churches for not obſerving <hi>Eaſter</hi> at his time. The thing in difference was, whether to keep it on the fourteenth day of the firſt month (the day on which Chriſt began his Sufferings) or on the next Lords day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>viz.</hi> the day of Chriſts Reſurrection. The Eaſtern Churches obſerved <hi>Eaſter</hi> on the fourteenth day of the firſt month accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the time of the Paſſover. The Weſtern Churches on the contrary ſaid, this was to Judaize, and it was more Chriſtian-like to celebrate the day of his Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on carried it. For in the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> it was concluded that it ſhould be kept on the day of the Reſurrection. This was the fruit of Gods Diſpleaſure againſt the Obſervation of ſuch a time, when he had teſtified in his Word, <hi>Let no man judge you in reſpect of Holy days,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And as to <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> they have greatly miſtaken in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the time (as hath been ſhewed) partly through the ignorance and unskilfulneſs which God was pleaſed to leave them to, as it were to rebuke them for their Superſtition; and partly through their carnal compliance with the Pagans; which made the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> take the old <hi>Saturnalia</hi> and <hi>Bacchanalia</hi> of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and to diſguiſe them with a new Name, that thoſe Feſtivities which had been kept before in the Devils name, might now be kept in Chriſts own name to his greater diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>Beſides there is little probability that the true time of Chriſts Birth is ſtumbled upon, and many learned men confeſs there is a miſtake as to the time, and that it muſt needs be at the Feaſt of Tabernacles, and not in <hi>December.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, God uſually gives men up to more ſin then, then at other time; which is a further evidence of his Diſpleaſedneſs with the Obſervation of it.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Latimers</hi> complaint of old, in the days of <hi>King Henry</hi> the eighth, That Chriſt was more diſhonoured in the Twelve Days, then in all the whole Twelve Months beſides. <hi>Ye obſerve days, and months, and years, I am afraid of you, that I have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.10, 11. it is a ſign the
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:96313:274"/>
preaching of the Goſpel hath been very much in vain among the people, when they retain the Obſervation of ſuch times; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks of the days and times that men have invented, not of days that God hath inſtituted to be obſerved.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>King</hi> 12.33. that he offered upon the Altar which he had made in <hi>Bethel</hi> the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the month <hi>which he had deviſed of his own heart,</hi> which he had lyed or feigned, <hi>quem mentitus eſt.</hi> The Lye of it appears in this, that they pretend to do it to the honour of Chriſt, when indeed they do it to his diſhonour: and therefore it is as a brand ſet upon him on this account, <hi>which he lyed in his own heart:</hi> ſo it is but lying, for men to keep days of their own invention; and the Lye appears in that they pretend to do it for the honour of God and of Jeſus Chriſt, whereas they unſpeakably diſhonour him thereby. It is the framing of a Lye in mens own hearts when they keep ſuch days.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſhould we not celebrate the memorial of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Jeſus Chriſt? why ſhould we forget the memory of theſe things? ſhould we not remember how Jeſus Chriſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and hath ſent his Spirit amongſt us, and came to tabernacle in our Fleſh?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, but the Lord commands us to celebrate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of it once a week, and for us to put him off with once a year, is to put him off with leſs then he requires; to give him a day in a year, when he requires a day in a week, for the memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and celebration of this thing.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there is a way whereby people may keep the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, and Pentecoſt, and the Feaſt of Tabernacles; that is, we ſhould keep them under the Goſpel every day. As ſome ſay, every day ſhould be a Chriſtian Sabbath. But that is not true; for a Sabbath is a day ſet apart from our Callings: but <hi>ſix days ſhalt thou labour,</hi> ſaith the Commandment. But we ſhould make every day our <hi>Eaſterday,</hi> every day our <hi>Pentecoſt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But why ſhould not Chriſtians be as holy as the Jews, and therefore keep theſe Feaſts as well as they? how ſhould we keep them every day?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="544" facs="tcp:96313:275"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We are to keep them in a ſpiritual and Goſpel way, but not legally and literally: for the Letter killeth, but the Spirit is Life. The Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>let us keep the Feaſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. Now if you would keep the Feaſts of Faſſover, Pentecoſt and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles aright, it conſiſts chiefly in three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To be much in the exerciſe of Faith, in the acting of a true and pure and lively Faith upon the Death and Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt as the true Lamb of God. I ſay, in acting Faith, or <hi>draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nigh with a true heart in full aſſurance of Faith;</hi> and this is the true Paſſover, and the true keeping of that Feaſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Let us keep the Feaſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. without the leaven of Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, of ſeeming Faith, and ſeeming Holineſs, <hi>with the unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth.</hi> That is the right keeping of the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, when men live not upon their own Righteouſneſs, truſt not in their own Duties; but being ſenſible of their ſinful, undone, wretched eſtate, act Faith, and exerciſe their thoughts upon the Death and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt: this is the right keeping of it indeed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Be ye filled with the Spirit,</hi> get a great and large meaſure of Gods Spirit; this is the true Feaſt of Pentecoſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Be not drunk with Wine wherein is exceſs,</hi> (as the Holiday-keepers uſe to be through the Juſtice of God, becauſe they obſerve their own inventions,) <hi>but be ye filled with the Spirit.</hi> Do not ſit down with common Gifts, and common Graces, and common Workings, but get and labour after the ſaving work of the Spirit; and be not content, nor ſit down ſatisfied with ſome little beginnings of a ſpecial ſaving work, with ſaving Grace in truth and in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in little meaſures and degrees: but labour after a great degree and meaſure of the Spirit of Grace; after ſtrength and growth of Grace, as well as truth of Grace; <hi>be ye filled with the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Behold and ſee the Glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. This is the true Celebration of the Feaſt of Tabernacles. Get a real ſight of God, ſo as to behold his Glory as he is <hi>manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> and as God dwells in our Nature, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>the Word was made Fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us, came and pitched his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:96313:275" rendition="simple:additions"/>
among us, and we beheld his Glory.</hi> We cannot ſee God in himſelf, he dwells in Light and Glory inacceſſible: as we cannot look upon the Sun in its own Brightneſs; but we may ſee it in a pail of Water: ſo we may ſee the infinite Majeſty and Glory of God in the Fleſh of Chriſt. The Tabernacle of Jeſus Chriſt is a thing to be beheld by Men and Angels, to ſee more into the Glory of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> get acquaintance with <hi>the myſtery of the Father and of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>that ye may be knit together in love and comforted, and unto all riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding, to the acknowledgment of the myſtery of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt, in whom are hid all the treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledg. But beware leſt any man ſpoil you through Philoſophy and vain deceit, after the Tradition of men, after the rudiments of the World, and not after Chriſt:</hi> ver. 8. <hi>for in him,</hi> ver. 9. <hi>dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Labour therefore to ſee God in Jeſus Chriſt: we are not able to behold that infinite Majeſty, but only through the veil of the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, as ſhining in his humane nature. And this is the myſtery of the Feaſt of Tabernacles, and the right and Goſpel way of celebrating of it. Conſider what I have ſaid, and the Lord give you underſtanding in all things.</p>

               <p>THere are three Doctrines in the words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Jewiſh Holy days are of three ſorts, or may be referred to three general heads; <hi>Feaſt days, New Moons, and Sabbaths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That theſe their holy ſeaſons were ſhadows of things to come, but the Body is of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore no Chriſtian ſhould ſuffer any man to judg him or condemn him for not obſerving theſe Jewiſh times and ſeaſons.</p>
               <p>We are endeavouring to open the ſubſtance of theſe ſhadows, and what were thoſe things to come, thoſe things about Jeſus Chriſt and the Goſpel which were ſhadowed forth in them.</p>
               <p>We began firſt with their Holy days, or their Feaſt days, that is, their annual Feſtivals, whereof we heard they had five. (1.) The Paſſover. (2.) Pentecoſt. (2.) The Feaſt of Tabernacles. (4.) The Feaſt of Trumpets. (5.) The Feaſt of Expiation. Theſe three, the Paſſover Pentecoſt and the Feaſt of Tabernacles, were the three great Feſtivals which were more ſolemn then the reſt; becauſe then all the Males of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to aſſemble together out of the whole Nation, and to appear before the Lord in the place that he ſhould chooſe, in a general Church Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>We heard ſomething that theſe things pointed to. The Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did point them to the Death and Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:96313:276" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as the true Paſchal Lamb, who fulfilled this Type even as to the very ſeaſon and holy time it ſelf; for he ſuffered at the Paſſover. The Pentecoſt pointed at the time of the effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt after his Aſcenſion. The Feaſt of Tabernacles pointed them to the Birth and Nativity of Jeſus Chriſt, when he ſhould come to tabernacle and pitch his Tent in our Nature.</p>
               <p>We heard indeed that this was the time of Chriſts Birth, and not as it is commonly computed to be in <hi>December,</hi> in the depth of Winter. It is not like the Shepherds would be watching their Flocks all night then, and that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> would command his Subjects to travel to their own Cities to be taxed at ſuch a time, and that <hi>John</hi> would chooſe that time to baptize in.</p>
               <p>There be two more of the Jewiſh Feaſts to be ſpoken to, which were great and ſolemn Feaſts; yet not ſo great as theſe three; becauſe the people were not all bound to come up to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to the Temple; namely, the Feaſt of Trumpets and the Feaſt of Expiation: they were both in the ſeventh month, as was alſo the Feaſt of Tabernacles; the Feaſt of Trumpets on the firſt day of it, the Feaſt of Expiation on the tenth day, and the Feaſt of Tabernales on the fifteenth day, and from thence to the two and twentieth day, which is therefore accounted the greateſt of all their Feaſts, being in the ſeventh month, which was alſo the firſt in their old account, the chiefeſt of all the months in the year, and called by ſome the Sabbath of months, as the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of days.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This month began with the <hi>Feaſt of Trumpets,</hi> which was upon the firſt day of the ſeventh month. The firſt Inſtitution of it we have in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.23, 24, 25. <hi>and the Lord ſpake unto</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>ſaying,</hi> &amp;c. It was celebrated as a Sabbath, they were to do no ſervile work therein. This Feaſt alſo had its peculiar Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices appointed for it, as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 29. the ſix firſt verſes. It was alſo ſolemnized with the blowing of Trumpets, which being the ſpecial Rite of this Feſtivity, it had its Name from thence. Here therefore the old legal Muſick may fitly be conſidered, this being as it were their Feaſt of Muſick. The Inſtitution of theſe Trumpets we read in <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. the ten firſt verſes, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:96313:277"/>
long after as a very ſolemn Ordinance in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.3, 4 The firſt mention we have of Muſical inſtruments in the Worſhip of God, is in <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.20, 21. where we read that <hi>Miriam uſed Timbrels,</hi> and they praiſed God therewith, and they ſang the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> when they were delivered from <hi>Pharaoh. And</hi> Miriam <hi>the Propheteſs, the Siſter of</hi> Aaron <hi>took a Timbrel in her hand, and all the Women went out after her with Timbrels and with Dances. And</hi> Miriam <hi>anſwered them, Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriouſly; the Horſe and his Rider hath he thrown into the Sea. Moſes</hi> afterwards by order from God appointed theſe Trumpets to be made, and we read of a further increaſe of ſuch Inſtruments in after times. As to the uſe and ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, there be many Goſpel Inſtructions to be conſidered in this legal ſhadow; we ſhall mention ſeven.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The general ſcope of them was to ſignifie and ſhadow forth the ſound of the Goſpel, the bleſſed ſound of the Goſpel, which is called <hi>the joyful ſound,</hi> Pſal. 89.15. the Goſpel is called <hi>glad tidings,</hi> it is a joyful pleaſant ſound indeed. Hence the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel are ſaid to <hi>lift up their voice like a Trumpet,</hi> Iſai. 58.1. <hi>the Tongue of the juſt is as choiſe Silver,</hi> Prov. 10.20. (theſe Trumpets were of Silver;) the faithful diſcharge and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their Office is expreſſed by <hi>blowing of the Trumpet,</hi> Hoſ. 8.1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.3, 4, 5. it is ſaid, in the day when the Jews ſhall be converted, <hi>in that day the great Trumpet ſhall be blown, and they ſhall come which were ready to periſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27. <hi>laſt.</hi> when God ſhall gather them one by one, <hi>ye ſhall be gathered one by one,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>in that day the great Trumpet ſhall be blown,</hi> &amp;c that is (ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi>) the Silver Trumpet of the Goſpel, to the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and converſion of the Jews. God will have his Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed not by ſight only, but by voice, not by the eye only, but by the ear. Even under the Law the Lord would not have his people always to look for miraculous and immediate Guidance, but they were to order themſelves according to the ſound of the Trumpet both in War Peace, according to the rule of the Word: ſo according to the rules of the Goſpel, according as that Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſounds, ſo are you to act. This is the firſt, namely, the
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:96313:277"/>
joyful ſound of the Silver Trumpet of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Joys and Graces of the Spirit of God is another thing intimated by this Trumpet and inſtrument of Muſick, that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual melody of the Joys and Graces of the Holy Ghoſt in the hearts of Gods people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98.6. <hi>with Trumpets and ſound of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net make a joyful noiſe before the Lord the King.</hi> Epheſ. 5.18, 19. There is a melody and joyful voice in the Conſciences of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, the Spirit of God both ſanctifying and comforting of them, ſo the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. Grace and Joy the fruit of Grace: ſo this Muſick remains in the Antitype of it, the heart-ſtrings of Believers making melody ſuitable to the profeſſion of their Lips, and to the gracious and peaceable converſation of their lives, that is the true Goſpel-Muſick.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe Trumpets and other muſical inſtruments were uſed in time of War, and appointed by God ſo to be, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.9. the Trumpets were to ſound to prepare and call them forth to the War, to encourage their Faith in it, that they ſhould be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred before the Lord, and have ſucceſs over their enemies; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times viſible ſucceſs attending this Ordinance: as in <hi>Jehoſaphats</hi> time, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.21, 22. <hi>they ſounded the Trumpet, praiſing the Beauty of Holineſs,</hi> and when they began to ſing praiſes, the Lord ſet ambuſhments againſt <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> and Mount <hi>Seir,</hi> and then they were ſmitten.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It was the Office of the Prieſts to ſound theſe Trumpets, as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.8. <hi>the Sons of</hi> Aaron <hi>the Prieſt muſt do it.</hi> To ſhew that the publick Diſpenſation of the Word and Goſpel belongs to, and is intruſted chiefly with the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Miniſters of the Goſpel, they muſt ſound the Silver Trumpet of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in the ears of the world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The matter they were made of, ſome were of Silver, and ſome of Horn, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.1. and in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.28. The Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, that is an inſtrument of Horn: ſo in that 98. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. <hi>with Trumpet and ſound of Cornet make a joyful noiſe before the Lord the King.</hi> And Rams Horns did beat down the Walls of <hi>Jericho, Joſh.</hi> 6. If God inſtitute the Rams Horns, they ſhall be as pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful as the Silver Trumpets. To teach us that the meaneſt Gifts
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:96313:278"/>
of any Godly Miniſters if ſincere are accepted, and may be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of God for the good of Souls, for the caſting down of ſtrong holds, and for ſucceſs and victory againſt our ſpiritual enemies; Rams Horns may do it as well as Silver Trumpets.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Their number at firſt was but two, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.2. that is, for the two Sons of <hi>Aaron, Eleazar</hi> and <hi>Ithamar</hi> the Prieſts, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.4. but in proceſs of time <hi>David</hi> added many other muſical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, but he did it by authority and direction from God. For ſo was the Commandment of the Lord by his Prophets, 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 29.25. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.42. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.6. And in <hi>Solomons</hi> time we read of one hundred and twenty Prieſts that did ſound with Trumpets at the Dedication of the Temple, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Alſo the Levites, which were the Singers, being arayed in white lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, having Cymbals, aad Pſalteries, and Harps, and with them one hundred and twenty Prieſts ſounding with Trumpets.</hi> And thoſe Inſtruments of Muſick which <hi>David</hi> made, they are called the Inſtruments of Muſick of the Lord: for he made them according to the direction of the Seer. All which ſhews the enlargement of the Church and its Joy, and the improvement of the Worſhip of God in Goſpel times: here is one hundred and twenty Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets now, whereas there was but two at firſt. And as the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Prieſts, and Trumpets and muſical inſtruments was much increaſed in <hi>Solomons</hi> time above what it was in the time of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> ſo ſhall the Church and their ſpiritual Joy in the days of the Goſpel under Chriſt, who is the true <hi>Solomon.</hi> They are increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed now, and ſhall be more and more in the later days, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 60, and 61 chap.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And laſtly, but why was this Feaſt of Muſick and Trumpets upon the firſt day of the ſeventh month, why is that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſeaſon for it?</p>
               <p>Many accounts there are given by Interpreters, which do all center in this; becauſe of the many great occurrences and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of God in this month, ſome whereof were paſt, and were now to be remembred, and ſome future, which were now to be proclaimed and prepared for. The World was created in this month, which was at firſt the firſt month in the year, until the
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:96313:278"/>
account was changed upon occaſion and in memorial of their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of <hi>Egypt. This month ſhall be to you the beginning of months,</hi> it ſhall be the firſt month of the year to you, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.2. intimating that it was not ſo before. There was approaching the Feaſt of Atonement upon the tenth day of this month, which is thought to relate to the Golden Calf, and the Lords pardoning that Idolatry: alſo the Feaſt of Tabernacles on the fifteenth day. The Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> was dedicated in this month: and now alſo was the Birth of Chriſt; at this time God aſſumed and appeared in our nature, pitching his Tabernacle or Tent in our Fleſh. All which things put together gives ſome account of the ſeaſon of this Feaſt, and of the ſolemnity of the blowing of Trumpets on the firſt day of this ſeventh month. And ſo much for the fourth of theſe annual Feſtivals, namely, the Feaſt of Trumpets.</p>
               <p>Now take this inference, namely, the unwarrantableneſs of Muſical inſtruments in the Worſhip of God now under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. You ſee of old there was an Inſtitution for it, there is not ſo now.<note place="margin">22 <hi>ae q.</hi> 91. 2. 4.</note> It is a very late invention of the Church of <hi>Rome: Aquinas</hi> ſpeaks againſt them as not uſed in the Church in his time, ſaying, they are legal, and prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure ſomething of Chriſt; therefore are not continued under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Conſider theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were a Type, that is evident; and hereby is typified the Muſick and melody of the Joys and Graces of the Holy Ghoſt in the hearts of Gods people, and many other Goſpel leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and inſtructions were held forth by this ancient legal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. And Types you know are ceaſed, and Shadowes are vaniſhed now that the Subſtance is come: look therefore after the inward muſick of a good Conſcience, and the witneſs of the Holy Ghoſt there; this is the Goſpel-muſick.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we could not find out the myſtery and the direct ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of them, which hath been cleared to you; yet however theſe things were a legal burthen, and childiſh rudiments, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not becoming the mature eſtate of Believers under the new
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:96313:279"/>
Teſtament, though they might be a fit ſolace for the childiſh eſtate of the Church under the Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Cathedral Muſick introduceth into the Church of God a Rabble of Church-Officers which the Lord never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and which never came into his heart, the Choriſters and Singing men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that is a very great evil. It is not in the power of men, but it is the great Prerogative of Jeſus Chriſt to appoint Officers in his Church, who hath appointed none but Paſtors and Teachers, Elders and Deacons.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, the Feaſt of Expiation or Atonement, and this was on the tenth day of this ſeventh month, the Rules and Rites whereof are ſet down at large in <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. which becauſe they are many, and very ſignificant, and full of Goſpel-myſteries: therefore I purpoſe (the Lord aſſiſting) to ſpeak to it more at large in a diſtinct Diſcourſe by it ſelf, having here only mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in its place to which it doth belong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Were theſe then all their yearly Feaſts? had they no more but theſe five under the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the Paſſover, the Feaſt of Pentecoſt, the Feaſt of Tabernales, the Feaſt of Trumpets, and the Feaſt of Expiation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They had no more of Gods appointment that were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and religious Feaſts. It is true, we read of ſome others both in Scripture and in the Jewiſh Writers; but either they were not perpetually recurring every year, but meerly occaſional upon preſent emergencies of Providence; or elſe they were not holy and religious Feaſts, but only civil and political; or elſe laſtly they were ſinful and unwarrantable: as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was <hi>Solomons</hi> Feaſt, that ſolemn Feaſt at the Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Temple, as in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. but this was extraordinary and occaſional, and not a ſtanding yearly Feſtival.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They had alſo thoſe Faſts of the fifth and of the ſeventh month which are mentioned in <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.3-5. but theſe alſo were but temporary and occaſional; upon occaſion of the calamities of their Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Land being laid deſolate, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> taken, the Temple deſtroyed. Hence they had theſe Faſts only during the time of their ſorrow, but they ceaſed and were turned into rejoycing.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="553" facs="tcp:96313:279"/>3. There was the days of <hi>Purim</hi> mentioned in <hi>Eſther</hi> 9.21, 22. that they kept in the month of <hi>Adar,</hi> on the fourteenth and on the fifteenth day of the month yearly: for then it was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſorrow to joy, and from mourning to a good day. This ſeems not to be a religious, but a political conſtitution; ſo our Divines conclude againſt the Papiſts, who plead this for their Popiſh Holidays. For there were peculiar Sacrifices appointed for all the holy Feſtivals, <hi>Numb</hi> chap. 28, and 29. but there was none for this: and there is nothing mentioned but civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, days of Feaſting and Joy, and ſending portions to the needy, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. Of this nature is our fifth of <hi>November.</hi> Not but that there may and ought to be upon ſuch times holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in God, as upon any providential occaſion: but there ought not to be a religious abſtinence from the works of our Callings (as upon the Lords day, and upon occaſional days of Faſting or Rejoycing) that ought not to be on any ſuch days. Had they been religious Feaſts and days wherein they were bound to abſtain from the works of their Callings, after the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of religious Feaſts, we then are to ſuppoſe that <hi>Mordecai, Nehemiah, &amp;c.</hi> had inſtruction from God about it, elſe they durſt not have done it, they that had ſuch Light and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We read of two Feaſts more appointed in the time of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> one for the Dedication of the Altar, 1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 4.56. <hi>ſo they kept the Dedication of the Altar eight days, offered Burnt-offerings with gladneſs, and offered ſacrifices of deliverance and praiſe.</hi> And the other for the Purification of the Temple, 2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 1.18. <hi>we are now purpoſed to keep the Purification of the Temple up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the five and twentieth day of the month</hi> Cheſleu. Now if theſe had been only particular and occaſional Feaſts, theſe things God had left with the Church to appoint; but ſeeing the Jews ſay, they were yearly Feaſts, they were thererefore ſuperſtitious and unwarrantable things; for they had no ſuch extraordinary perſons amongſt them that could give them authority from God for ſuch a thing.</p>
               <p>

               <p n="2">2. The ſecond word in the Text is <hi>New Moons,</hi> of which we read in <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.11. <hi>in the beginnings of your months ye ſhall offer a Burnt-offering unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of your months ye ſhall blow with the Trumpets over your Burnt-offerings,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To open this a little, that ſo you may underſtand the mind of the Holy Ghoſt in it; you muſt obſerve that their computation of the year was not as ours is, meerly Solar, but partly Lunar: for their month always began with the <hi>New Moon,</hi> and the days remaining to fill up their Solar year, which are eleven, they were wont to intercalate at the appointment of their High Preſts and Rulers at the years end: Or (as ſome write) after the ſecond or third year in an intercalatory month which they called <hi>Veader,</hi> conſiſting of eleven, or one and twenty, or three and thirty days. Their month ſtill began with a New Moon, and the Lord did appoint that it ſhould be a ſeaſon religiouſly obſerved by them; you ſhall offer ſuch and ſuch Sacrifices, <hi>ye ſhall blow with Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There were four things obſervable in the ſolemnizing the <hi>New Moons:</hi> for they did ſolemnize this ſeaſon with ſuch religious Rites and Obſervations as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A holy Convocation and abſtaining from the works and buſineſs of their Callings: Therefore in <hi>Amos</hi> 8.5. they are brought in as ſaying, <hi>when will the New Moons be gone, that we may ſell Corn,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By repairing to the Prophets for Teaching and Inſtruction, to inquire of God, and to hear his Word. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.23.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="555" facs="tcp:96313:280"/>3. With ſounding or blowing of Trumpets every <hi>New Moon,</hi> as well as the <hi>New Moon,</hi> of the ſeventh month, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. With peculiar Sacrifices, yea a greater number of Sacrifices then on the Sabbath day: They had peculiar Sacrifices then to be offered on the firſt day of the month, <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.11.</p>
               <p>Some add (fifthly) the keeping ſolemn Feaſts of Love and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.5.6.</p>
               <p>Now this Solemnity doubtleſs had ſome Divine myſtery in it, it aimed at ſome good thing to come, ſomething of Chriſt in the Goſpel: for the Text ſaith expreſly, <hi>they were a ſhadow of things to come.</hi> And the Worſhip of God in Goſpel-times is expreſſed under this phraſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.23.— <hi>from one New Moon to another</hi>— ſo <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in his Viſion of the Temple-worſhip under the Goſpel ſpeaks of it under the name of <hi>New Moons, Ezek.</hi> 46.1, 6.</p>
               <p>But what then did it ſignifie? what was the meaning of all theſe things? Doubtleſs they were written for our Inſtruction, there was a Goſpel-myſtery in theſe legal Inſtitutions. In theſe things principally lay the ſubſtance of theſe ſhadows.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their acknowledgment of God in the Creature, that God muſt be acknowledged in the renovation of the Creatures in the courſe of Providence: as when the Moon begins, increaſes, and is renewed, then Gods Providence is acknowledged and taken notice of: he renews the courſe of nature and every mercy we enjoy. There is no Light to be ſeen at firſt in the Moon, but it increaſes till it come to the full Moon. Thus God renews eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature and every comfort in the way of his Providence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.30. <hi>thou ſendeſt forth thy Spirit, and they are created, and thou reneweſt the face of the earth.</hi> They muſt not bleſs God in this Solemnity for the Moon when it was at the full; then more of the Creature is ſeen: but when there is leaſt of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then God muſt be owned even in the leaſt of mercies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Renovation of the Church in a way of Grace, as well as the Creature in the way of Providence; we muſt own God in that, and depend on him for it: for the Church is compared in Scripture to the Moon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.37. <hi>it ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever as the Moon, and as a faithful Witneſs in Heaven.</hi> Cant. 6.9. <hi>Who
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:96313:281"/>
is this that looketh forth fair as the Moon,</hi> &amp;c. As the Moon bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows her Light from the Sun: ſo the Church borrows her Light from Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Sun of Righteouſneſs. As the Church is compared to the Moon: ſo Chriſt to the Sun; for ſo he is called, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. <hi>but to you that fear my Name ſhall the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe with healing in his Wings.</hi> The Church bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows her Light from Chriſt the Sun of Righteouſneſs, as the Moon doth from the Sun in the Firmament: for Chriſt is compared to the Sun, as well as the Church to the Moon. As the Moon bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows her Light and Luſtre from the Sun, and is renewed by the aſpects and influences thereof: ſo the Church by influences from Chriſt, who is indeed the Sun of Righteouſneſs, renewing the ſtate of the Church eſpecially under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And therefore all thoſe Duties which were to be performed on the New Moons, ſo far as they are perpetual, ought to be more plentifully and more abundantly performed under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: as abſtaining from ſervile works, from ſin, the worſt of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitudes, ſeeking inſtruction, and attending upon the Ordinances for that end, the ſounding of the ſilver Trumpet of the Goſpel, abounding in ſpiritual Sacrifices, and agreeing in love and amity, eating their Bread in ſingleneſs of heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here ſeemeth to be likewiſe ſome intimation of that great myſtery of the Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt, I mean his Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghoſt in the Womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> For this aimed at Chriſt, as all the other Ceremonies of the Law and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly times and ſeaſons did. And ſome have gone about to make it out, thus; That look as Chriſt fulfilled other great Types and Ceremonies of the Law in other things: ſo he did in this. As the Feaſt of Tabernacles pointed to the time of his Birth on the fifteenth day of the ſeventh month: ſo if from thence we reckon thirty eight weeks backward, it will carry us to the change of the Moon, at which time is a great conjunction or union of thoſe two great Luminaries the Sun &amp; the Moon. Here they think may be ſome dark and weak ſhadow of the conjunction or union of the two Natures of Chriſt in one perſon; when he became <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which he did, as in the whole ſtate of his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:96313:281" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo eſpecially when he was conceived in the Virgins womb.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The New Moon is put for every thing beneath Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1. the world, which in reſpect of the changeableneſs of it, is like the Moon, the world and the glory thereof paſſeth away, never ſtanding at the ſame ſtay. This ſhould be frequently upon our hearts and thoughts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They were to obſerve the firſt day of the month, not the fifth or ſixth day: ſo alſo their morning Sacrifice was to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered early in the morning; and the Paſſover celebrated the firſt month in the year. To teach them, that as ever they expected the Bleſſing of God upon the reſt of their time, they muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſet apart the firſt and beſt of all their days and hours unto his ſervice.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They were to obſerve the firſt day of every month, one as well as another, which checks that ſuperſtitious conceit, as if there were lucky and unlucky times: whereas God hath ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied every month and every time to his people: as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the wicked the moſt lucky times prove diſaſtrous: as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Papiſts that famous year 1588. crowned with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Aſtrological Praedictions of enſuing happineſs, and Victory proved quite contrary to their expectations: ſo that <hi>Fulke Pref.

No month to a godly man is of it ſelf evil, but let a wicked <hi>Haman</hi> caſt lots from the beginning of the year to the ending, he ſhall find no month good.</p>
               <p>So much for the myſtery of their <hi>New Moons,</hi> the ſecond ſort of their holy times: the firſt was their <hi>annual Feaſts,</hi> the ſecond their <hi>New Moons,</hi> the third is their <hi>Sabbaths.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="558" facs="tcp:96313:282"/>This is the third ſort of holy times and ſeaſons under the Law.</p>
               <p>The general notion of a Sabbath is a time of Reſt.</p>
               <p>They had three ſorts of Sabbaths, their weekly Sabbath, every ſeventh day; their yearly Sabbath, every ſeventh year; and their great ſabbatical year, reckoning ſeven times ſeven years, which was their Jubilee every fiftieth year. In every one of which was ſomething of a ſhadow of things to come, the Apoſtle is expreſs, <hi>theſe things are a ſhadow of things to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Wherein?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Sabbath of the ſeventh day, their weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath on the ſeventh day of the week; this was partly moral and perpetual, conſidered as a ſeventh part of weekly time ſanctified and ſet apart by God from common uſe, for man to reſt from the works of his weekly Calling, in imitation of God, and in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the great work of the Creation of the world.</p>
               <p>But though the Sabbath be partly moral, and it muſt needs be ſo, ſeeing it is one of the Ten Commandments, otherwiſe there would be but nine moral Commands, and the original ground of a Sabbath is not a ceremonial Inſtitution, nor the ſin and fall of man, but a particular Calling; and therefore <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocent and ſinleſs eſtate needed a Sabbath; and God ſanctified this day before the fall of man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. but yet the Jewiſh Sabbath was in ſome reſpects Ceremonial, and therefore it is abrogated, and the Chriſtian Sabbath ſubſtituted in ſtead thereof: and therefore the Holy Ghoſt here in the Text reckons the Jewiſh Sabbaths in the ſame rank with their New Moons and yearly Feſtivals amongſt the ſhadows of good things to come; for it had ſome typical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and uſes, ſome ceremonial Rites and Obſervations annexed to it. I ſhall inſtance in two things wherein it is typical.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Commemoration of their typical Redemption and Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Therefore though the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, as it is recorded in <hi>Exod.</hi> chap. 20. is grounded upon the Labour of a particular Calling, and upon Gods reſting from the work of Creation upon the ſeventh day; (which are moral grounds) yet in the fourth Commandment, as it is repeated <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. one of thoſe moral conſiderations is omitted, <hi>viz.</hi> the work of
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:96313:282"/>
Creation; and there is a typical conſideration ſubſtituted in ſtead thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt. Deut.</hi> 5.15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As there was in the Jewiſh Sabbath a Commemoration of that typical Redemption out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> ſo ſecondly it was a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Prefiguration of the Reſt of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Grave that whole day, which was indeed the only whole day of his reſting or ceſſation from the actions of a bodily life: For he was in the Grave only ſome ſmall part of the ſixth day, and of the firſt day; but he reſted the whole Jewiſh Sabbath. So then, as they had other legal days and times that pointed them to other things about the Meſſiah: ſo the Sabbath points to his reſting in the Grave, And he did not only reſt in the humbling of himſelf under the guilt of our Sins, but in his Reſurrection from the dead. The day of his Reſurrection was the day of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into his ſtate of reſt from his Sufferings; but on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath he reſted from the actions of his bodily life: therefore the ſeventh day Sabbath is abrogated, and the Lord hath ſubſtituted the firſt day of the week; for the Sabbath is moral. And there is a ground too for the changing of the day, that there ſhould be one day in ſeven to attend on the Worſhip of God, this is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and perpetual: that it ſhould be the laſt day in ſeven, this is by Gods Inſtitution made legal and typical.</p>
               <p>Chriſt entred into his reſt of Glory, into the ſtate thereof at his Reſurrection; and into the place thereof when he aſcended into Heaven; but his reſting in the grave was on the ſeventh day.</p>
               <p>From all which you may ſee the morality of the Sabbath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as in general, together with the ſhadowy nature of the Jewiſh Sabbath of the ſeventh day, having theſe typical reſpects &amp; relations annexed to it: and ſo therein you ſee the grounds of the abrogation of it, and of the ſubſtitution of the Chriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath inſtead therereof.</p>
               <p>And ſo much may ſerve for the typical reſpects and uſe of the Jewiſh Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Now as for the Rites and Obſervations thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There were more Sacrifices that day then upon other days, <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.9, 10. The reaſon was becauſe there were more Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:96313:283"/>
given and commemorated that day, as the Creation, their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and their Sanctification by the Spirit: <hi>It ſhall be a ſign between me and them, that they might know that I</hi> Jehovah <hi>do ſanctifie them,</hi> Exod. 31.13. Ezek. 20.12, 20.</p>
               <p>Here learn, that the more Bleſſings God gives to any people, the greater thankfulneſs he expects again.</p>
               <p>It reacheth alſo that ſpecial Holineſs that ſhould be upon the Sabbath; more exerciſe of Grace, and duties of Worſhip to be performed upon that day then ordinarily upon any other day: there ſhould be that among us on the Chriſtian Sabbath that ſhould anſwer their double Sacrifice upon their Jewiſh Sabbath. But in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46.45. there is appointed for the Sabbath ſix Lambs for one under the Law; to teach us that there ſhould be more Holineſs now under the Goſpel, then there was under the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They might not kindle a fire on that day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.3. as ſome think, to put them in mind of their abſolute freedom from their Egyptian Bondage and the fiery Brick-works there, or from the fire of Gods Wrath in the world to come, when entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that none of theſe fires ſhould ever be kindled upon them or hurt them; though others think that reſtraint reſpected only kindling a fire for the building of the Tabernacle nor is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They were to abſtain from building the Tabernacle that day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. and 35.2. to teach them that the ſix days, that is, the time of this life is the only time wherein God will build the Tabernacle of his Church: this life is the only day of Grace and opportunity of Salvation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They might not gather Manna on that day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. In this life Chriſt is offered, but in the Sabbath of eternity no Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, no means of Grace, no offers of Chriſt then: none could have Manna upon the Sabbath, but they that had ſtored it up upon the week day: ſo none can have Chriſt in Heaven, but they that have ſtored him up in their hearts on earth.</p>
               <p>Theſe things ſhew the rigor of the Law as to Sabbath-reſt; but the Phariſees being deeply poſſeſt with the ſpirit of the Law,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:96313:283"/>
did ſtrain it a peg or two higher, that to do a miraculous work of mercy, or works of neceſſity was unlawful.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They had alſo a <hi>Sabbatical year, viz.</hi> every ſeventh year, a Sabbath of the ſeventh year: every ſeventh year was a Sabbatical year, as every ſeventh day was a Sabbatical day. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.9.</p>
               <p>This was celebrated by letting the Land reſt from its uſual cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and husbandry. <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.4, 5.</p>
               <p>Some alledge a political and philoſophical reaſon for this, that the Land by reſting one year might be the more fruitful the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſix; <hi>quod caret alternâ requie durabile non eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Sabbatical year was celebrated by giving reſt unto the Land from tillage, and manuring the hungry ground.</p>
               <p>This was a ſhadow of things to come, this ſignifies ſomething of Chriſt and Goſpel myſtery, in which obſerve four things.</p>
               <p>There was a fourfold Inſtruction in this Sabbatical year.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Sabbatical year told them plainly that both they and their Land was the Lords, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.23. <hi>For the Land is mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This taught them to depend upon Providence, without worldly care, and truſting to the Creature for ſupply and ſupport. For they muſt not now ſow nor till the Land this year: for the ſixth year was to bring forth the Fruit of three years, both for the ſeventh year, and for the eighth, and for the ninth till the Harveſt time. See <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.20, 21, 22. and ver. 6. <hi>the Sabbath of the Land ſhall be meat for thee.</hi> The Land of its own accord that year was to produce ſuſtenance enough both for man and beaſt.</p>
               <p>It is not enough for us to depend on the ordinary courſe of means; God can over-rule them and over-work them, as he doth here.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord hereby teacheth them and us that great Goſpel-leſſon and duty of mercy and bounty to the poor, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.10, 11. the Land muſt reſt, that the poor may eat, and <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.1, 2. Creditors muſt releaſe their Debtors every ſeventh year, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.5, 6. there is an Equity, a Chancery, a bountiful condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the neceſſities of the poor, that men exact not their own right in all things; but rather remit and abate ſomething thereof.
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:96313:284"/>
Not but that men may take their courſe, and uſe means to get it, eſpecially when perſons are able and wilful; but in caſe of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there ſhould be mercy ſhewed in ſuch a caſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Sabbatical year was a ſpecial ſeaſon and time of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Law of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.10, 11, 12. the Lord would have them inſtructed and taught to know his Mind, and the true Religion, and the ways of his Worſhip: Therefore he appointed ſo many times and ſeaſons for it, weekly and monthly and year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and moreover one year in ſeven, as you ſee. Beſide the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of ſpiritual reſt by Chriſt, of which further in the next par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Jubile.</hi> There was alſo a third Sabbath, beſide the weekly Sabbath, and the ſeventh year Sabbath; they had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Sabbath of ſeven times ſeven, that is the Jubile. This was their great Sabbatical year; for they were to reckon ſeven times ſeven years, and then to obſerve a Sabbatical year. <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.9.</p>
               <p>This alſo was a Type of Chriſt, as appears in three things, that were done in this year of Jubile.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was Redemption and Releaſe, every one ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, every bondage releaſed, and every yoke broken.</p>
               <p>Here is a ſhadow of the ſpiritual and true Redemption by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who of ſpiritual ſlaves by nature makes us the Lords Freemen by Grace. Chriſt hath proclaimed Redemption to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and Deliverance to poor captive ſouls. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was the Trumpet of the Jubile to proclaim it. The Goſpel is this great Trumpet, the proclaiming of the Jubile is alluded to, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.1, 2— <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27. ult. <hi>in that day the great Trumpet ſhall be blown.</hi> The great Trumpet is the Goſpel, <hi>Calv. in loc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Some have obſerved further, that the coming of Chriſt was at the Jubile, that Chriſt came at the time of the Jubile.</p>
               <p>I know there is ſome difference amongſt Chronologers about it; but ſure it is, it fell thereabout: ſome placing the Jubile upon the preaching of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> who did proclaim the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but others place it as ſeemeth more exactly upon the very
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:96313:284"/>
year of Chriſts Death, by which we were redeemed and ſet free indeed.</p>
               <p>They began the account of their Jubiles from about <hi>anno mundi</hi> 2560. for they came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> about the year 2513. they were forty years in the Wilderneſs, ſix or ſeven in conquering and dividing the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Then began their firſt Sabbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal year; from thence to the Death of Chriſt there were eight and twenty Jubiles, his Death being about the year of the world 3960.</p>
               <p>So you ſee ſomething of the Goſpel-myſtery of theſe Sabbaths of the Jews, the three ſorts of Sabbaths; every week, every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year, and every fiftieth year: and thus alſo you ſee how theſe legal holy times and ſeaſons were all ſhadows of good things to come.</p>
               <p>Take ſome general Uſes from the whole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. See and remember the unlawfulneſs and unwarrantable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Obſervation of theſe Jewiſh times and ſeaſons under the Goſpel: for they were typical. <hi>Amos</hi> 5.21.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts obſerve the Paſſover, which they call <hi>Eaſter;</hi> Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt, commonly called <hi>Whitſuntide;</hi> and inſtead of the Feaſt of Tabernacles they keep the five and twentieth of <hi>December</hi> for the time of Chriſts Birth; all which we retain. And they have alſo added a Jubile, which becauſe it is a profitable time to the Popes Purſe, he hath ordered it to be kept every five and twenty years inſtead of fifty.</p>
               <p>Theſe are Errors of dangerous conſequence, for they do impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly deny that the Subſtance is come.</p>
               <p>If theſe things were <hi>ſhadows of things to come,</hi> the retaining of them now, is an error of dangerous conſequence: For to retain any of theſe dark and legal ſhadows is an implicit denial that Chriſt the ſubſtance is come. Theſe things were more fully ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the laſt time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. See and obſerve the burthenſomneſs of that old legal Diſpenſation, as alſo our Chriſtian liberty now under the Goſpel. The Lord requires no day of us but the Lords day, and occaſional days of Humiliation or of Thankſgiving upon emergencies of
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:96313:285"/>
Providence calling thereunto. <hi>Stand faſt therefore in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made you free,</hi> Gal. 5.1. <hi>and be not again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the yoke of bondage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. And laſtly, ſee wat clear and plentiful evidence the Jews had concerning Jeſus Chriſt, that he was the true Meſſiah; and how true this of the Apoſtle in the Text is, that <hi>they are a ſhadow of things to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Put all theſe things together, and you will ſee theſe Jewiſh days made up a rude draught or dark ſhadow of the good things that were to come under the Goſpel in ſundry particulars rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Body, which is of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance, they lead to the time of his Conception by the Holy Ghoſt on the firſt day of the month.</p>
               <p>To the time of his Birth and Nativity, being born on the firſt day of the Feaſt of Tabernacles, and circumciſed the eighth.</p>
               <p>He ſuffered at the time of the Paſſover.</p>
               <p>He lay and reſted in the Grave on the Jewiſh Sabbath.</p>
               <p>He poured forth his Spirit at their Feaſt of Pentecoſt.</p>
               <p>The Jews might have found the Body by theſe ſhadows, had they been attentive to mind the things belonging to their peace: they might have thought when they ſaw ſuch a conjunction, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is he that comes ſpeedily to redeem <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And you, though you have a conviction of the truth of the Goſpel; yet get a further and fuller conviction of it from this, that Jeſus Chriſt was ſo plainly ſhadowed forth to us by all theſe ancient Diſpenſations.</p>

               <p>THis Chapter is wholy taken up in declaring the <hi>Feaſt of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation</hi> or Atonement upon the tenth day of the ſeventh month.</p>
               <p>It is more properly and indeed a Faſt, but yet commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Feaſt, as taking the word in a more lax acceptation for any ſet or ſolemn time.</p>
               <p>And though it was indeed a day of afflicting their Souls, yet there was joy in the end of it: for their peace was made with God, and the Jubile proclaimed this day.</p>
               <p>It was, with all the Services and Adminiſtrations of it, the moſt full and compleat ſhadow of the great work of our Redemption that we meet with under the Law; the High Prieſt repreſenting in all he did, that which Jeſus Chriſt the true High Prieſt was to do indeed in the fulneſs of time.</p>
               <p>I ſhall endeavour to explain it a little to you, as God ſhall enable me, following the method of this Chapter, and ſo you will be able to read it more underſtandingly and with edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Wherein the firſt thing that doth occur is, the occaſion of the Inſtitution, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>viz.</hi> the Death of the two Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> when they offered before the Lord and died, which Story is recorded <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Some add, that Man fell upon this day; but this is not likely. It ſeems more probable from all the circumſtances of the Story, that he fell upon the ſeventh day.</p>
               <p>For that he was not fallen upon the ſixth day appears by this,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:96313:286" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that in the cloſe of the ſixth day God approves all his Creatures that they were good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. ult. therefore ſin had not yet ſpoiled them.</p>
               <p>And if he had ſtood out the whole Sabbath day, it is probable he had been confirmed by eating of the Tree of Life. For it is probable that upon the Sabbath he ſhould have enjoyed all the Ordinances of God; and conſequently that the Sacrament of that eſtate ſhould have been the concluding Ordinance: as under the New Teſtament they were wont to break Bread every Lords day. And in the primitive times the Sacrament was the conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance. But Man did not eat of the Tree of Life; for then he had been confirmed and lived for ever, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not likely that he ſtood in his integrity to the end of the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>And as to the time of the day wherein he ſinned, it ſeems to have been about eating time, at dinner, about noon; eating what they ſhould not, being the thing wherein they ſinned.</p>
               <p>And after his Fall it is ſaid, that <hi>God came and ſpake to them in the cool of the day.</hi> Gen. 3. ver. 8. This ſeems to have been about that time of the day which the Scripture calls the ninth hour, which is after our reckoning about three a clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon. So long they were in darkneſs, and under guilt of their Sin, before the Promulgation of the Goſpel to them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome have obſerved a congruity, in that Jeſus Chriſt was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe his infinite Sufferings upon the Croſs the ſame ſpace of time, from the ſixth hour to the ninth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.45, 46.</p>
               <p>And it being thus, Man in his firſt ſin and fall did break all the Commandments at once: as he brake all the reſt, ſo he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon the Sabbath day.</p>
               <p>This ſeems by all the circumſtances of the Story to have been the time of his Fall.</p>
               <p>But to think that he fell on <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the tenth day from the Creation, there is nothing in the Hiſtory to evince it.</p>
               <p>Others think, this Faſt on the day of the ſeventh month was appointed in remembrance of the great Sin the Idolatry of the Golden Calf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="567" facs="tcp:96313:286"/>But we may reſt in that the Text mentioneth as the occaſion of this Ordinance, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sin and Death of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there is a threefold Inſtruction we are here to learn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. Here we are taught firſt, <hi>That there muſt be holy fear and reverence in approaching to God in his Ordinances,</hi> an holy fear and dread of ſinning in the manner of his Worſhip: and that it is a dangerous thing to worſhip God otherwiſe then he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Men ſhould take heed of it, that they die not as <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> did for this ſin: they incur the danger of Death, both Death temporal and eternal.</p>
               <p>Though God doth not uſually ſmite men with viſible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but when they are firſt in any tranſgreſſion; yet there is a ſpiritual fire and wrath upon their ſpirits for it, which is worſe then outward Judgments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The <hi>Lord takes hold of the ſaddeſt occaſions to bring in Diſpenſations of the greateſt good and mercy to his people,</hi> Light out of Darkneſs, Heaven out of Hell, good out of evil, to thoſe that he hath ſet his Love upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. <hi>When ſome are ſlain, and die in and for their ſins, the Lord provides for the Salvation of others, that they die not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to come to the thing it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> is to charge <hi>Aaron</hi> that he come not into the Holy of holies at all times, nor in any manner, but at Gods appointed times, and in ſuch manner as he requireth. This manner is here deſcribed at large. It conſiſts chiefly in three things. (1.) His waſhing himſelf. (2.) His holy Garments. And (3.) His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory Offerings.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Prieſt muſt waſh before he put on his Garments, and before he preſent his Offering, is an intimation of his Purity and Cleanneſs. Hence that expreſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, and our Bodies waſhed with pure water.</hi> This is the firſt thing he is to do.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.16. was baptized before he entred upon his Miniſtry; and he was perfectly holy and pure, not having the leaſt defilement of ſin upon him, though he had taken on him
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:96313:287"/>
our Nature, and all the other Infirmities of it. <hi>Vid. On the Prieſts Conſecration Exod.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to his Attire, here be two ſorts of holy Garments men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Services of this day; the holy Garments, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and other holy and moſt coſtly Garments, <hi>ver.</hi> 23.24. Some call the former his White Garments, and the other his Golden Garments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Prieſtly Attire was an emblem of ſpiritual clothing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.9. <hi>Let thy Prieſts be clothed with Righteouſneſs, and let thy Saints ſhout for joy:</hi> and ver. 16. <hi>I will alſo clothe her Prieſts with Salvation.</hi> Job 29.14. <hi>I put on Righteouſneſs, and it clothed me: my Judgment was as a Robe and a Diadem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then ſpeaks the Grace and Holineſs that was in Jeſus Chriſt, and ought to be in Miniſters, ſuch Garments Miniſters ſhould be clothed with.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe two ſorts of Attire, the White and the Golden Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſignified the different eſtate and condition of Jeſus Chriſt; when he performed the great work of our Redemption, and made atonement for us; he did it in much meanneſs and abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.14. his Viſage was marred— he was without external Pomp and worldly Glory, in the form of a Servant, made himſelf of no Reputation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. though with Holineſs and Purity, and Innocency: He had white Garments on, though they were but plain.</p>
               <p>But as there is a clothing of Grace: ſo there is a clothing of Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2, 4.</p>
               <p>And after his Reſurrection, when he had been in Heaven and returned again, and aroſe and appeared from the dead, he did change his Raiment: He wore the garments of Holineſs here; but when he entred into the holy place, even into Heaven, he did put on garments of Glory.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the holy Garments on this day of Expiation.</p>
               <p>Now the third thing is, the Offerings of Atonement; and they were of two ſorts, for the Prieſt, and for the People.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Prieſt himſelf, and for his own Houſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 6. This teacheth us the inſufficiency and imperfection of the legal
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:96313:287"/>
Prieſthood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1, 2.3. we need a better High Prieſt, and we have one. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26, 27, 28.</p>
               <p>The Prieſt was firſt to make atonement for himſelf and for his own ſins, that ſo he might be fit, as a figure of Chriſt the true High Prieſt, to make atonement for the people. They that lie under unpardoned guilt themſelves, are not fit to be Mediators and Interceſſors for others.</p>
               <p>The Prieſt had three things to do in reference to his own Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He was to kill it, and ſo to make atonement with it, <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>This was a Type of the Death of Chriſt the true Sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He was to offer Incenſe in the Holy of holies, <hi>v.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>This is a Type of the Prayers and Interceſſions of Jeſus Chriſt in the virtue of his Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Here are four particulars obſervable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As the High Prieſt did this before he ſprinkled the Blood in the Holieſt of all: ſo Chriſt prepared his own way into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by his Prayers and Interceſſions. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Incenſe was beaten ſmall, to intimate the anguiſh, and contrition, and brokenneſs of heart wherewith Chriſt prayed and interceded for us; thoſe agonies of ſpirit in his Prayers before his Death, which he offered up unto God with ſtrong crying and tears, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.37. <hi>he began to be ſorrowful and very heavy,</hi> and ver. 38. <hi>then ſaith he unto them, my Soul is exceeding ſorrowful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto death:</hi> and ver. 39. <hi>he fell on his face and prayed, ſaying, Oh my Father, if it be poſſible let this Cup paſs from me.</hi> Luk. 22.44. <hi>And being in an agony, he prayed more earneſtly, and his Sweat was as it were great drops of Blood falling down to the ground. Hebr.</hi> 5.7.</p>
               <p>It ſpeaks alſo the Contrition and brokenneſs of heart that is in the Prayers of the Saints.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He took a cenſer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar, to kindle the Incenſe. It is the fire of the Altar, the Spirit of God that inflames the Affections in Prayer, that ſets the heart on fire, and makes the Incenſe flame, ſets Grace on work: and as the Spices whereof the Incenſe was made, are the Graces of Gods
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:96313:288"/>
Spirit; and the beating of them ſmall is the Contrition of the heart: ſo the Incenſe muſt be ſet on fire with ſacred fire; the Spirit of God inflaming the heart with earneſt deſires and ardent affections after God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Cloud of Incenſe muſt cover the Mercy-ſeat; <hi>that the Cloud of Incenſe,</hi> that is, the Smoke thereof, <hi>may cover the Mercy-ſeat, that he die not.</hi> ver. 13.</p>
               <p>There is much Inſtruction in this.</p>
               <p>If we think to behold the Mercy-ſeat without the Cloud of Incenſe, we die. It is the death of many a Soul, that in the day of Atonement, when they are afflicting their Souls for ſin, they think that God is merciful, and they cry to God for Mercy: But they do not behold the Mercy of God in the Son of his Love, they do not look up to the Mercy-ſeat as covered and clouded with the Incenſe of the Merits and Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt: and therefore they die and periſh even in the day of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onement, when they come before the Mercy-ſeat.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Blood muſt be ſprinkled upon the Mercy-ſeat Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that is, upon the forepart of it. <hi>ver.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>It teacheth us, that as the High Prieſt went into the holy place not without Blood: ſo <hi>Chriſt with his own Blood,</hi> Heb. 9.7, 11, 12. <hi>hath entred into Heaven for us,</hi> to make way for us to come thither alſo, by the merit and virtue of his own Blood and Satisfaction. Heaven therefore is called <hi>the purchaſed poſſeſſion,</hi> Epheſ. 1.14. becauſe purchaſed by the Blood of Chriſt: <hi>We have boldneſs to enter into the holieſt by the Blood of Jeſus.</hi> Hebr. 10.19, 20.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Blood muſt be ſprinkled upon the Mercy-ſeat <hi>ſeven times.</hi> A myſtical number often uſed in the legal Services, and hath been formerly explained.</p>
               <p>It is a number of perfection; God having created the World in ſix days, and reſting upon the ſeventh. It therefore notes a full and perfect cleanſing and applying of the Blood of Chriſt for that end. And it preſuppoſeth a copious and liberal effuſion; but it implies directly a plenteous and effectual application of the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="571" facs="tcp:96313:288"/>Get the Blood of Chriſt effectually applied unto thy Soul, or elſe thou canſt never look God in the face with any comfort or acceptance: take this Blood of Chriſt, apply it by Faith, ſee how it atones God.</p>
               <p>It is true, the Blood of Chriſt doth not make God merciful, but it makes way for the exerciſe of his Mercy: it doth not cauſe the attribute of Mercy to be in God, but it makes way for the putting of it forth.</p>
               <p>Now then let us put both theſe together. The Mercy-ſeat muſt be both clouded with Incenſe and ſprinkled with Blood, or elſe there is no approaching for Sinners into the preſence of God, none but through the Prayers and Interceſſions, and through the Blood and Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Non ſolum periculoſum ſed horribile eſt de Deo extra Chriſtum cogitare.</hi> It is not only dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi>) but it is an horrible thing to think of God out of Chriſt. Do not think to make uſe of Gods Attributes in an immediate way, but by the Interceſſion of a Mediator; there is no Mercy in God for Sinners out of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the Prieſts Offerings for himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort of Offerings upon this great day of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were for the People; and theſe are <hi>two Goats for a Sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a Ram for a Burnt-offering.</hi> ver. 5.</p>
               <p>The Rites and Ceremonies of theſe two Goats are full of the Goſpel. It is pity that choiſe portions of Scripture, which have ſo much in them, are commonly ſo little underſtood by us. Let us in the help of Chriſt inquire a little into the myſtery of theſe things.</p>
               <p>Of the Burnt-offering there is ſomething ſaid, but it is not much, the common rules of the Burnt-offering being here to be obſerved. But the Sin-offering of the two Goats, there be many very ſignificant Rites and Ceremonies about them.</p>
               <p>This Sin-offering is firſt generally, and then ſeverally and more particularly ſpoken to, and the ſeveral actions about them more particularly opened.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In general, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that they had to do which was peculiar to it
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:96313:289"/>
was, that theſe two Goats, they were <hi>to caſt lots upon them.</hi> Now a Lot is a referring of a thing by an appeal to the determination of Providence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.33. <hi>the Lot is caſt into the lap, but the whole diſpoſing thereof is of the Lord.</hi> There is a ſpecial hand of Providence in a Lot: ſo it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. <hi>Him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered by the determinate Counſel and foreknowledge of God, ye having taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and ſlain.</hi> The Lot in this buſineſs was to determine which of the Goats ſhould be ſlain, and which was to eſcape.</p>
               <p>But why were there two Goats, one to die, and the other to eſcape? The reaſon was plainly this; Becauſe that one alone was not ſufficient to repreſent the Myſtery intended and aimed at. For Chriſt was both God and Man, he both died and roſe again; but the ſame Sacrifice could not both die and live again without a miracle. Therefore theſe two Goats were appointed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent more compleatly the whole myſtery of our Redemption in all the concernments of it; to ſhadow forth Jeſus Chriſt in both his Natures, and in both the ſtates he paſſed through, both in his Divinity and in his Humanity, both in his Humiliation and Exaltation. As in like manner there were two Birds appointed in the Purification of the Leper. <hi>See of the cleanſing of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Lev.</hi> 14. pag. 398.</p>
               <p>So here two Goats, a flain Goat, and a ſcape Goat; the one to ſhadow forth Chriſt as dying and ſlain for our offences, the other as riſing again for our Juſtification. The ſlain Goat repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Chriſt as he was put to death in the Fleſh, that is, in his Humane nature: the ſcape Goat repreſented him as quickened by the Spirit, that is, by his Deity raiſing him up again from death to life. This in general. Now,</p>
               <p n="2">2. In particular, the ſacred Rites and Ceremonies about theſe Goats are ſeverally ſpoken to from <hi>ver.</hi> 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He begins with the ſacred actions about the ſlain Goat, and then ſpeaks</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the ſcape Goat.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſacred Actions and Ceremonies about the ſlain Goat were ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="573" facs="tcp:96313:289" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. The ſprinkling of the Blood thereof upon the Mercy ſeat and before the Mercy-ſeat, <hi>&amp;c. ver.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>This repreſents the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which made way for him and us into Heaven, into the preſence of God: as the Blood of the Bullock for the Prieſt beforementioned was, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. where the meaning of this Rite was opened.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Prieſt hereby muſt make an atonement for the holy place, for the Tabernacle, becauſe of the uncleanneſs of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael. ver.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>This teacheth us, that the very Ordinances of God, and our holy Services therein have a ſecret defilement cleaving to them through our being exerciſed in them. If the Tabernacle be pitch'd in the midſt of an unclean people, the Tabernacle it ſelf muſt be atoned. How ſhould this beat down our being proud of Ordinances, and haughty, becauſe of Gods holy Mountain, as the Prophets phraſe is, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.10. thoſe carnal boaſtings that we are ſubject to, ſuch as thoſe of theirs that ſaid, <hi>the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are theſe.</hi> Jer. 7.</p>
               <p>If the Ordinances were not ſprinkled with the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, they could never be accepted, they could be never be effectual for good unto us. Not that Duties and Ordinances are unclean or impure in themſelves; but we defile them by the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Corruption that is in us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Prieſt muſt enter alone into the holy place when he doth this. <hi>ver.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>So Jeſus Chriſt was alone in the work of our Redemption, and purging away of our ſins. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>He by himſelf purged our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is an horrible and dreadful error of the Papiſts that joyn other Mediators with him: this is to ſend others to go along with the High Prieſt when he atones the holy place.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He muſt go out from the Brazen Altar of Offerings to the Golden Altar of Incenſe, and atone it by putting the Blood of the Sin-offering upon the Horns thereof. <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19. There are many things here.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Chriſts Interceſſion is founded in his Oblation: for
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:96313:290"/>
the Golden Altar is a Type of his Interceſſion. Now this muſt be ſprinkled with Blood; to teach us, that by the virtue of Chriſts Death and Blood, his Prayers and Interceſſions are available and effectual with God.</p>
               <p>And look whom he died for, thoſe he prayed for.</p>
               <p>To ſeparate his Death and Interceſſion, is to divide what God hath joyned. To think that he died for ſome, for whom he doth not pray, is as if the High Prieſt ſhould neglect or forget one part of his Office, which requires not only that he kill the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but that he ſprinkle the Blood of it upon the Altar of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe. Therefore if Chriſt hath ſhed his Blood for Reprobates, he will not forget to ſprinkle it upon the Golden Altar for them. If he hath died for them, he will pray for them. But it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, he doth not pray for ſome, and himſelf aſſerts it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.9. therefore he did not die for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This teacheth us, how it is that our Prayers come to be accepted; it is becauſe ſprinkled with the Blood of Chriſt, they need cleanſing and purging: the Incenſe Altar muſt be atoned. <hi>Lava lachrymas meas Domine.</hi> Lord waſh my tears.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Horns of the Altar of Incenſe ſprinkled with Blood denotes the efficacy and ſtrength of Prayer when ſprinkled with the Blood of Chriſt, both his Prayers for us, and ours alſo in his name. Hence <hi>Revel.</hi> 9.13. we read of a Voice from the four Horns of the Golden Altar which is before God, that is, anſwers and returns of Prayers from the power of God awakened and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by Prayer.</p>
               <p>But this third particular belongs rather to the Altar of Incenſe, as the proper place to which it ſhould be referred.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Rites and Ceremonies of the ſcape-Goat, whereto ſome other things alſo are annexed from <hi>ver.</hi> 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall put them altogether in ſeven particulars, ſome concerning the ſcape Goat, and ſome other Rules and Obſervations in this day of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation, moſt of them mentioned in this Chapter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Prieſt muſt confeſs their ſins over the head of the ſcape Goat. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. This ſcape Goat was a Type of Chriſt, <hi>God laid on him the iniquities of us all,</hi> Iſai. 53.6. and we are to do it by
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:96313:290"/>
Faith, confeſſing our ſins with an eye to him, as being born by him in our ſtead. Many of the damned have confeſſed their ſins, but not over the head of a dying Saviour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſcape Goat carries their ſins afar off into the land of Oblivion, <hi>ver.</hi> 21.22. far from the ſight and preſence of God in the Temple. A moſt lively ſhadow and repreſentation this is of that great myſtery of the Pardon and Forgiveneſs of Sin: for ſo Chriſt carries our Sins away into the land of oblivion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.12. <hi>As far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, ſo far hath he removed our tranſgreſſions from us:</hi> that <hi>though they be ſought for, they cannot be found.</hi> Jer. 50.20. If Conſcience ſeek for them, it cannot find them: for Conſcience is pacified when ſprinkled with the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. If Satan ſeek for them, he cannot find them: for they are gone and loſt in the Wilderneſs. Yea, if Juſtice it ſelf ſeek them, yet they cannot be found: for Juſtice is ſatisfied by the Death and Blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The High Prieſt is now to go into the Tabernacle, and there to change his Raiment, and there to waſh himſelf, and to come forth and offer the Burnt-offering, and burn the fat of the Sin-offering according to the Ordinance. <hi>ver.</hi> 23, 24, 25.</p>
               <p>I put all theſe together, becauſe they have all been formerly opened in the ſeveral places to which they appertain: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may ſuffice now only thus to bind them up together, as it were in one bundle, for the help of memory, and ſo paſs on to the next. The myſtery of the Prieſts Attire was opend on <hi>ver.</hi> 4, and 23, 24. The Burnt-offering on <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. pag. 244.</p>
               <p>The burning of the Fat on <hi>Levit.</hi> 3. in the Peace-offering, pag. 285. where this Rite is firſt mentioned. It was there ſhewed how it ſignifies the giving unto God the beſt of our Spirits and Services: and in another accommodation of the metaphor; the conſuming and burning up of ſinful Corruption. <hi>See</hi> p. 299, 300.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He that carried away the ſcape Goat muſt waſh his Clothes, and ſo come into the Camp. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. And the like again <hi>ver.</hi> 28. He that is the Miniſter of theſe holy actions muſt waſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as having contracted guilt; which denotes not only the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of the Levitical Prieſthood, but alſo it may inſtruct us
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:96313:291"/>
in the iniquity of all our moſt holy actions. <hi>See of this upon the Sin-offering on</hi> Lev. 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 323.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Sin-offerings, buth the Bullock and the Goat, muſt be burnt without the Camp. <hi>ver.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>This alſo is explained upon the Sin-offering, <hi>Lev.</hi> cap. 4. pag. 321, 322. that Chriſt ſuffered without the City as a Malefactor, with whom we alſo ſhould ſuffer, bearing our reproach, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing content to be accounted as Malefactors, yea as the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the offscouring and ſweeping of the world.</p>
               <p n="6">6. On this great day of Atonement was the Jubile to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by ſound of Trumpet. <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.9.</p>
               <p>This ſpeaks, that after the performance of the whole work of our Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, he did cauſe the Trumpet of the Goſpel to ſound, to publiſh and proclaim the glad tidings of our Salvation throughout the world, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.1, 2. ſo that this day of Atonement is like that famous week propheſied of by <hi>Daniel</hi> cap. 9. <hi>He ſhall confirm the Covenant with many for one week. In the midſt of the week Meſſiah ſhall be cut off.</hi> This week is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by ſome concerning that ſeven years, the firſt part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Chriſt preached, ſuffered in the middle of the week: and in the other three years and an half the Apoſtles preached at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> after which they were diſperſed by perſecution, and ſo the Goſpel publiſhed to all the world.</p>
               <p>It is the performance of the work of our Redemption, that was the foundation and groundwork of the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: the Jubile is proclaimed upon the day of Atonement.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And laſtly, this day of Atonement is a day of Humiliation and afflicting their Souls, by an everlaſting Ordinance. <hi>ver.</hi> 29, to the end.</p>
               <p>Days of Humiliation are days of Atonement and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Not that our Humiliation merits or deſerves any thing: it is not the afflicting our Souls that doth make atonement; but it fits us to receive the Atonement. Humiliation prepares the Soul for Chriſt, and makes it capable to receive the Mercy and the Pardon that Chriſt hath purchaſed, and that God is willing and ready to beſtow upon all that will receive it by Faith.</p>

            <head>THE MANIFOLD SINFULNESS OF THE POPISH HOLY DAYS, Diſcovered in ſundry Reaſons againſt them, and the moſt material Objections anſwered.</head>
            <p>AMongſt the ſeveral ways wherein the Superſtition of the hearts of men works out and vents it ſelf, this is one, <hi>the obſerving of Days and Times,</hi> wherein the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath abounded, filling the Kalender with ſuperſtitious Holy days, many of which are ſtill retained and continued by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But let theſe Reaſons againſt them be conſidered.</p>

                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1.</head>
               <p>Nothing can be holy to the Lord, which is not made holy by the Lord: but God the Lord of time hath not ſanctified nor ſet apart theſe times. We find indeed before the Ceremonial Law was inſtituted, yea before the Fall of Man, that <hi>God bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it,</hi> Gen. 2.2, 3. and therefore the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a weekly Sabbath one day in ſeven is moral and perpetual. But other <hi>Holy days</hi> are things which the Lord never commanded, and which never came into his heart, and of which
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:96313:292"/>
he will ſay at the great Day, <hi>who required theſe things at your hands.</hi> The ſtrength of which argument will appear the more, if we conſider what miſerable poor ſhifts it puts the Patrons of theſe <hi>Holy days</hi> to, when they go about to grapple with it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes they are ſo confounded in themſelves, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that they place Holineſs in theſe days: the Church keeps them (they ſay) <hi>not as more holy and ſacred then other days and parts of divine Worſhip, but only for Order and Policy.</hi> So Biſhop <hi>Lindſey, Perth. Aſſ part.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 5. But the reſt of his Fellows have dealt more truly and more ſincerely then he in this particular: for not only <hi>Bellarmine (tom.</hi> 2. <hi>de Cultu Sanctorum, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>prop.</hi> 2.) aſſerteth, <hi>Feſta Chriſtianorum non ſolum ratione Ordinis &amp; Politiae, ſed etiam ratione myſterii celebrantur, ſuntque dies feſti vere aliis ſanctiores ſacratiores &amp; pars quaedam divini cultus.</hi> But <hi>Hooker (Eccleſ. Pol. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>ſect.</hi> 69. <hi>pag</hi> 375.) alſo ſaith <hi>they ought to be, with all men that honour God, more holy then other days. Downham (in Praec.</hi> 4.) refers them to the fourth Commandment, and will have them conſecrated as Sabbaths to the Lord. Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> (in his <hi>Holiday Sermons</hi> on <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. on <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.39, 40. <hi>apud Gilleſp. Eng. Pop. Cerem. part.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 15.) hath found out many profound myſteries in them, yea in the very order of them, and diſtances of time between them: as, there be fifty days between <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Pentecoſt, becauſe fifty is the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Jubile; one day between</hi> Eaſter <hi>and the Reſurrection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> Jonas <hi>was but one day in the Whales belly;</hi> with many other pretty tales, which are not worth tranſcribing. And the thing it ſelf ſpeaks: for why do they call them <hi>Holy days,</hi> if they put no holineſs in them? nay, why do they prefer them above the Sabbaths of God?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes they labour to eſcape in the miſt of blind di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions: ſo when Biſhop <hi>Lindſey (Perth. Aſſ. part.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 28.) ſaith, that the <hi>Holy dayes</hi> are not conſecrated <hi>to holy myſtical uſes, but to holy political uſes.</hi> Wherein, as Mr. <hi>Gilleſpy (Eng. Pop. Cer. part.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 7.) well obſerveth, <hi>he doth but labour to plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter over his Superſtition with the untempered mortar of this quiddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative diſtinction and uncouth ſpeculation, of which, I dare ſay, the Biſhop himſelf comprehendeth it not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="579" facs="tcp:96313:292"/>3. Sometimes they ſay God hath ſanctified them, by the great works he hath done upon them. Thus <hi>Bellarmine (de Cult. Sanct. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.) <hi>Chriſtus naſcens conſecravit locum, id eſt, praeſepe, moriens conſecravit Crucem, reſurgens conſecravit Tuntulum unde exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit; cur non etiam conſecravit Tempus, id eſt, Dies illos quibus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, vel paſſus, vel rediturus fuit nobis devictâ morte?</hi> Which his Diſciple <hi>Rich. Hooker,</hi> a moſt Papiſtical Writer, borrows from him, and thus expreſſeth it, (<hi>Eccl. Pol. lib.</hi> 5. § 69. <hi>p.</hi> 375.) <hi>No doubt, as Gods extraordinary preſence hath hallowed and ſanctified certain Places: ſo they are his extraordinary works that have truly and worthily advanced certain Times, for which cauſe they ought to be, with all men that honour God, more holy then other days.</hi> Thus he.</p>
               <p>But it is not meerly the extraordinary works of God that will ſanctifie a day, for then all the ſix days of the week ſhould be holy: for God created the World in ſix days; ſo that there is not one day of the week wherein there was not ſome work of wonder wrought. It is rather the Lords reſting from his works, then his working that ſanctifieth Time and makes it holy; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>Exod</hi> 20.11. Upon this ground the ſeventh day was ſanctified in old time, becauſe on that day God reſted from the work of Creation; and upon the ſame ground the firſt day of the week, being the Reſt-day of the Lord our God from the great work of Redemption, his former Reſt being diſturbed and ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Fall and Sin of Man, is our Chriſtian Sabbath. But theſe Popiſh <hi>Holy days</hi> are not the Lords reſting days, nor is any ſuch thing pretended.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They commonly put it upon the Church, and ſay, the Church hath ſet apart theſe times; but this is not enough to make them holy: for all that the Church can do towards the ſanctifying of any time or thing, is only to preſent it and offer it to the Lord; but if the Lord do not accept them, but refuſe ſuch Preſents, and caſt them down as dung in their faces, they are not Holineſs to the Lord, but an abomination to him. As ſuppoſe the Church of the Jews had offered Swines fleſh unto God, would this have made Swines Fleſh holy? no verily, becauſe the Lord not did not accept it. So here, the Church dedicates theſe
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:96313:293"/>
days to the Lord, but there muſt be ſome Word of God to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence his acceptance of them, or elſe they are not indeed holy times, but ſuperſtitious times, of which the Lord will ſay at the great day, <hi>who required theſe things at your hands? whatſoever is not of Faith is ſin.</hi> Iſai. 1.12.

               <p>There is not only no warrant in the Scripture for them, but clear and ſharp reproofs and teſtimonies againſt them. It was one part of the Superſtition of the Phariſees in our Saviours time, <hi>to faſt twice a week,</hi> Luke 18.12. Thoſe old Papiſts the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, and our new Phariſees the Papiſts, being men of the ſame Spirit, and acted by the ſame Principle, and walking in the ſame ways of Superſtition. And it was the brand ſet upon <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.33. that <hi>he ordained a Feaſt unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>upon the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even the month which he had deviſed of his own heart,</hi> which he had lyed or feigned, as the word ſignifies, <hi>aſher bada millibbo, quem mentitus eſt de corde ſuo:</hi> And though it was <hi>like unto the Feaſt that was in</hi> Judah, v. 32. and though he pretended the Glory and Worſhip of that God, <hi>that brought them up out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, as well as the eaſe and accommodation of the People, <hi>v.</hi> 28. yet all this would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him. And what is <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> and <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and all the reſt of them, but days which the <hi>Jeroboam</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath deviſed of his own heart?</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Pope</hi> had them from the Jews and from the Pagans; for what is <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> but the old heatheniſh <hi>Bacchanalia?</hi> It is kept at the ſame time of the year, and after the ſame profane man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, only the <hi>Pope</hi> hath varniſhed it with a new name. But how ill it becomes a Chriſtian to keep the Pagan Feſtivals, hear what <hi>Tertullian (de Idol. cap.</hi> 14.) ſaith. <hi>Nobis</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>quibus Sabbata extranea ſunt &amp; neomenia &amp; feriae aliquando à Deo dilectae, Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia &amp; Januariae &amp; Brumae &amp; matronales frequentantur, munera commeant, ſtrenae conſonant, luſus convivia conſtrepunt?</hi> and is not this as lively a deſcription of <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> as if it had been purpoſely
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:96313:293"/>
intended for it? but thus he inveighs againſt them; <hi>O melior fides nationum in ſuam ſectam, quae nullam ſolennitatem Chriſtianorum ſibi vendicat, non Dominicum diem, non Pentecoſten, etiam ſi noſſent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſcum non communicâſſent, timerent enim ne Chriſtiani viderentur, nos ne Ethnici pronunciemur, non veremur.</hi> 
                  <q>We that do not own nor obſerve the New Moons, and other Jewiſh Feſtivals appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of old by God himſelf, do we keep the Heatheniſh <hi>Baccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia,</hi> and other Winter and Summer Feaſts of theirs, feaſting and revelling, and making merry as the Heathens do? O how, much more true are they to their Religion, then we to ours; For they do not obſerve any day that Chriſtians obſerve, as <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt</hi> or the Lords day; for they would be afraid leſt they ſhould ſeem to bee Chriſtians in ſo doing: but we are not afraid leſt we be pronounced to be Heathens.</q> Thus he. It is true, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> as a Feaſt obſerved by Chriſtians in thoſe times; but how this can be defended, and all the reſt of the Jewiſh Feaſts caſhiered, let the Chriſtian Reader judge.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle makes no difference, but condemns the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Jewiſh Feſtivals alike, one as much another. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Let no man judge you in meat or drink, or in reſpect of an holy day, or of the New Moon, or of the Sabbaths, which are a ſhadow of things to come.

And Mr. <hi>Allin</hi> alſo is of the ſame Judgment, which he gathers from <hi>the half week which the Angel,</hi> Dan. 9.27. <hi>ſeems to hold out to be between the Baptiſm of Chriſt and his Death: for if there was juſt ſo much between them, his Death being juſt at the Paſſover, which was about the end of our firſt month, called</hi> March; <hi>then his Baptiſm muſt needs be about the latter end of</hi> September. Thus Mr. <hi>Allen, ubi ſupra.</hi> Which argument indeed to me is very ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying, being grounded upon ſuch clear Teſtimonies of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. For that Chriſt was baptized and entred upon his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry at thirty years old, we find recorded, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.23. and that he preached three years and an half; beſides other arguments may be gathered from that in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.27. <hi>in the midſt of the week ſhall the Meſſiah be cut off;</hi> which is meant of a Prophetical week containing ſeven years: therefore there muſt be half a week, that is, half a year above the three and thirtieth: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the common account makes but a quarter of a year between the <hi>Nativity</hi> and <hi>Eaſter.</hi> Of which much more might be ſaid; but this is enough to ſhew that the Feſtivals are grounded upon a very miſtaken and uncertain foundation, which is a further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that they are not of God.</p>

or rather to the Superſtition, and therefore ſtands or falls together with it. The Apoſtle therefore calls them Idolaters even for their Feaſting and Sporting, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.7. <hi>neither be ye Idolaters, as were ſome of them, as it is written, the people ſate down to eat and drink, and roſe up to play.</hi> And if we read the Story of that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the Calf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. we ſhall find that it was celebrated much after the ſame manner that <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> is, or rather ſomewhat better; for <hi>they roſe up early on the morrow, and offered Burnt-offerings and Peace-offerings:</hi> ſo that it ſeems they went to Church and ſaid their Prayers moſt devoutly in the morning, and then <hi>they ſate down to eat and drink, and roſe up to play,</hi> v. 6. and there was <hi>ſhouting, and ſinging, and dancing,</hi> and a great deal of mad mirth amongſt them, v. 18, 19. Sober mirth, and the temperate uſe of the good Creatures of God, is lawful at any time of the year, and there never was any Miniſter that preached or ſpake againſt that. But to have better cheer upon a <hi>Popiſh Holy day</hi> then at another time, meerly upon this account, becauſe, forſooth, it is an Holy day, this is ſuperſtitious. And the revelling and rioting and luxury, which is uſual at thoſe times, is every way an hinderance to Hoſpitality, and not a furtherance to it, that which might and ought to be beſtowed in a way of liberality to the poor, being miſpent and laviſhe'd away in vain prodigality and luxury.</p>

His words are theſe; <hi>Nor for my part</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>do I make any ſcruple to keep a day in remembrance of any eminent Servant of Chriſt or Martyr, to praiſe God for their Doctrine or Example, and honour their memorial: but the hardeſt part of the queſtion is, whether it be lawful to keep days as holy, in celebrating the memorial of Chriſts Nativity, Circumciſion, Faſting, Transfiguration, Aſcenſion, and ſuch like.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ric.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This learned man is very ſingular in this Opinion, as well as in many others, and it is contrary even to the common Senſe and Reaſon of moſt Chriſtians, yea of moſt men, to think the days dedicated to Saints more allowable then thoſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:96313:299"/>
of the actions of Chriſt himſelf.

If it were</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a good and pious thing to appoint Holy days; this Piety were better imployed in ſo many Commemorations of the actions of Chriſt, as the Church could bear, then in turning aſide to the Saints. To dedicate a day unto God in remembrance of a man, is a thing which the very Jews were never taught to do in thoſe weak and childiſh times, much leſs doth it agree to the ſpiritual Worſhip of the New Teſtament. And though it were lawful</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright Firſt Reply</hi> p. 153.) <hi>for the Church to ordain Holy days to our Saviour Chriſt, or the bleſſed Trinity; yet it is not therefore lawful to inſtitute Holy days to the Apoſtles and other Saints, or to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to that pretenſe of honouring their memorial, I remember this is alledged by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for the keeping of Reliques, and Dr. <hi>Ames (Bellarm Enerv. tom.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>theſ.</hi> 25.) his anſwer to him, <hi>De iſtiuſmodi conſervatione nihil traditur in Scripturâ, ubi tamen omne genus honoris virtuti defertur,</hi> may be applied here; this is ſuch a way of honouring the memorial of Saints departed, as the Scripture knows not, wherein yet all due honour is given to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and holineſs. <q>For as we reaſon againſt the Popiſh Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory (ſaith Mr. <hi>Cartwright, Firſt Reply p.</hi> 153.) that it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nought, foraſmuch as neither in the Old Teſtament, nor in the New, there is any mention of Prayer at any time for the Dead: ſo may it be reaſoned againſt theſe Holy days ordained for the remembrance of the Saints; that foraſmuch as the old people did never keep any Feaſt, or Holy day, for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance either of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Daniel,</hi> or <hi>Job,</hi> or <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> or any other, how holy or excellent ſoever they were.

               </p>
               <p>And what though ſome of theſe Corruptions crept in ſome what early? they are but old ſins, and grey-headed errors.</p>
               <p>That Antichriſtian violence of <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>Eaſter</hi> was about the year of Chriſt one hundred ninety eight, but <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> is not ſo ancient. <hi>Pezelius</hi> refers the firſt eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it to the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the year of Chriſt five hundred fifty three. <hi>Celebrata eſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Conſtantinopoli Synodus Oecumenica quinta circa annum Chriſti</hi> 553. <hi>In eadem Synodo dies natalis Chriſti &amp; dies Purificationis Mariae primum ſunt inſtituti ut ſolenniter quotannis celebrarentur.

               <p>
                  <hi>Socrates,</hi> who wrote the Hiſtory of the Church above twelve hundred years ago, hath a whole Chapter concerning <hi>Eaſter,</hi> wherein he hath many notable arguments againſt thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo much for it.

               </p>
               <p>He ſheweth alſo <q>that the Apoſtles have ſet the Churches free from the yoke of bondage, by their Letters to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. But ſome neglecting theſe things, account of Fornication, as a thing indifferent; yet they contend about Holy days as it were for life and death, they deſpiſe the Commandments of God, and eſtabliſh them Canons of their own, they ſet at nought, they make no account of the Law publiſhed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, but raiſe a foul ſtir about Days and Months, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>In <hi>Scotland</hi> they were laid aſide in the firſt Reformation, and have been witneſſed againſt by the Godly there ever ſince.

For one of the five Articles of that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly was concerning Feſtival days; but they found little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with ſuch as adhered to the Reformation of Religion, as appears by the Books and Writings of many godly learned men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Acts of that Aſſembly.

But theſe were his Principles in his firſt, which were his beſt times.</p>
               <p>In <hi>England,</hi> beſides the frequent Teſtimonies of the Martyrs againſt them, Authority hath ſmitten them once and again, the Lord uſually carrying on the work of Reformation by degrees. The firſt blow they received by publick Authority was by the Injunctions of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, in the year 1536. in the Preface whereto, he reaſons thus againſt them; <hi>Foraſmuch as the number of Holy days is ſo exceſſively grown, and yet daily more and more by mans devotion, yea rather Superſtition, was like further to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, that the ſame was and ſhould be not only prejudicial to the Commonwealth, by reaſon that it is occaſion as well of much ſloth and idleneſs, the very Nurſe of Theeves, Vagabonds, and divers other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftineſs and inconveniences, as of decay of good Myſteries and Arts profitable and neceſſary for the Commonwealth, and loſs of mans food many times, being clean deſtroyed through the ſuperſtitious obſervance of the ſaid</hi> Holy days, <hi>in not taking the opportunity of good and ſerene weather offered upon the ſame in the time of Harveſt; but alſo pernicious to the Souls of many men, which being inticed by the licentious vacation and liberty of theſe Holy days, do upon the ſame commonly uſe and practiſe more exceſs, riot, and ſuperfluity then upon any other days,</hi> &amp;c. See Mr. <hi>Fox Acts and Monum. vol.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 386. whereupon he abrogates a number of them, and eſpecially ſuch as ſell in the Harveſt time. And thus the work was begun.</p>
               <p>But the total extirpation of them was a work and honour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by God for the <hi>great Parliament,</hi> who in their <hi>Directory pag. ult.</hi> have declared, that <hi>Feſtival days vulgarly called Holy days, having no warrant in the Word of God, are not to be continued.</hi> And in their Ordinance of <hi>June</hi> 8. 1647. they do utterly aboliſh

            <head>THE SUPERSTITIOUS VANITY OF THE POPISH MUSICK IN THE WORSHIP of GOD.</head>
            <p>THis is ſuch a ſtrange ſuperſtitious Vanity that it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally accounted in theſe knowing times, as it was of old by <hi>Juſtin Martyr (Queſt. &amp; Reſp.</hi> 107) childiſh and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, inſomuch that it doth expoſe the Papiſts and their way of Worſhip to much contempt and laughter: and therefore I ſhould have thought it needleſs to ſpeak much againſt a thing ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally exploded, but that Mr. <hi>R.

His words are theſe; <q>For Organs or other inſtruments of Muſick in Gods Worſhip, they being an help, partly natural and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly artificial, to the exhilerating of the Spirits for the Praiſe of God; I know no argument to prove them ſimply unlawful, but what would prove a Cup of Wine unlawful, or the Tune, and Meeter, and Melody of Singing unlawful: but yet if any would abuſe it, by turning Gods Worſhip into carnal Pomp and Levity, eſpecially by ſuch non-inteligible ſinging or bleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſome of our Choriſters uſed, the common people would have very great cauſe to be weary of it, as accidentally evil.</q> Thus he, <hi>Diſp. of Humane Cerem. p</hi> 412.

            </p>
            <p>And firſt to that plauſible Objection of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> from the uſe of them in the Old Teſtament, to begin with the ſtrongeſt Argument firſt: for this is the moſt ſpecious, and hath the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſeeming weight. But though the Jews had Muſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Worſhip of God under the Law, yet that they are no part of Goſpel-worſhip: theſe Conſiderations may evince.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There was then a clear word of Inſtitution for them. The Trumpets of Silver and Cornets of Horn were inſtituted by the hand of <hi>Moſes, Numb.</hi> 10. in the ten firſt verſes, and <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.23, 24. we read alſo in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time of Timbrels uſed in the publick Praiſes of God by <hi>Miriam</hi> the Propheteſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.20. and in <hi>Davids</hi> time we read of Organs alſo, and ten-ſtringed Inſtruments, and Cymbals of Braſs, and Harps, and Pſalteries of fine wood, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.3. and 150.4. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.4, 5. and theſe Muſical inſtruments were not brought into Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by <hi>David</hi> of his own head, but by Authority and Direction from God. <hi>For ſo was the Commandment of the Lord by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> ſaith the Text, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.25. and therefore they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the muſical inſtruments of God,</hi> 1 Chron. 16.42. and <hi>inſtruments of Muſick of the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 7.6. with relation to God as the Author and Inſtitutor of them. For the Lords Name in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture phraſe is never ſet upon things of Humane invention, but only upon things of Divine inſtitution; as <hi>the Lords Supper, the Lords Day, the Lords Feaſts, the Lords Altar,</hi> &amp;c. ſo here the <hi>Lords Inſtruments of Muſick.</hi> And indeed had there not been ſuch a Stamp of God upon them, they had been abominable; and thoſe words of God by the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> 5.23. might juſtly

Tarnov. in loc.</hi> For the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with loathing whatever he hath not commanded, <hi>reſpuit quicquid non praecepit,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerves upon that text: A text which condemns <hi>the mutterings of the Maſs-Prieſts, and the bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Friars and Nuns, wherwith the Churches and Chappels in the Papacy eccho;</hi> to uſe the words of the learned Lutheran <hi>Tarnovius</hi> upon that place.</p>
            <p>But there is not one word of Inſtitution for them under the Goſpel, neither expreſly nor by Conſequence: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they are clearly caſhiered and excluded out of the Goſpel-worſhip, by that general Rule which the Apoſtle lays down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all the parts of Gods Worſhip, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 26. <hi>let all things be done unto edifying,</hi> with ver. 15. <hi>I will ſing with the Spirit, and I will ſing with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding alſo;</hi> and verſ. 11. <hi>If I know not the meaning of the Voice, he that ſpeaketh ſhall be a Barbarian to me.</hi> From all which the Rule is evident, that <hi>no Voice is now to be heard in the Church of Chriſt, but ſuch as is ſignificant and edifying by ſignification, which the voice of Inſtruments is not.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cott. of Singing Pſalms cap.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 6. The Chaunters and Choriſters are (to uſe the Apoſtles phraſe) Barbarians to all the people; for they play and ſing no body knows what: the underſtanding can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not edifie by it, being not an articulate voice.</p>
            <p>And therefore thoſe Compariſons of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> when he paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels the uſe of Organs in Gods Worſhip with a Cup of Wine, and with the Tune, and Meter, and Melody in Singing, are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous and unmeet compariſons. For <hi>what communion hath Light with darkneſs, and what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols?</hi> So when <hi>Bellarmine (de Bonis Operib. partic. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.7.) mingles the Queſtion of Organs with that of Singing Pſalms, handling them both together in one; It is too much boldneſs thus to confound and parallel the Inventions of men with the Inſtitutions of Jeſus Chriſt. We know there is an Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chiſt for the uſe of Bread and Wine in his Worſhip, in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, as alſo for the ſinging of
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:96313:303"/>
Pſalms, to which the Tune and Meter are as neceſſary as Cups and Veſſels for the Bread and Wine: But where hath Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Organs and Cathedral Muſick? who required theſe things at your hands?</p>
            <p>The time when this Corruption was firſt invented and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the Church is not certainly known, neither is it much material to diſpute. Certain it is, that they are a very late In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. They were not uſed in <hi>Juſtin Martyrs</hi> time, who lived in the ſecond Century; and it is generally thought by learned men, and not without ground, that that Book, though it bear his Name, was indeed much later then his time, where they are thus witneſſed againſt; the Teſtimony is very plain and punctual, and therefore let us hear it in Engliſh; <hi>Singing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in it ſelf is not a childiſh thing, but to ſing with inſtruments of Muſick, and with Dancing, and Timbrels.

            <p>What it was, that was the thing intended and ſignified by theſe dark ſhadows, is not without ſome obſcurity and difficulty to determine.

For it is not natural Reaſon but Divine Inſtitution that is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of religious Ceremonies, as is moſt apparent in the two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of Baptiſm and the Lords Supper. Doth natural Reaſon teach theſe? neither will his Rule ſtand, that nothing is proper to the Jews, but only ſuch Ceremonies as ſignifie ſome future thing. For a plenteous Induction of inſtances might be given,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:96313:305"/>
in ſundry legal Burthens and Ordinances of thoſe times, which we all account our ſelves delivered from, though we do not well know what typical ſignification to aſſign unto them. It will be hard to demonſtrate what typical ſignification there was in that reſtraint of the initiating Seal preciſely to the eighth day; or in that Law that a man ſhall marry his deceaſed Brothers Wiſe, to raiſe up ſeed unto his Brother, with many other things of the like nature, which yet are not now in force.</p>
            <p>And upon this account alſo, this inſtrumental Muſick is reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many judicious Writers, as being a burthen laid upon the Jews, or an Indulgence allowed unto them in that eſtate of infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but now the time of Goſpel Freedom is come, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>Judaeis fuerat permiſſum propter infirmitatem cordis ſui,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom in Pſal.</hi> 150. <hi>Quia populus erat magis durus &amp; carnalis, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin. ſecund. ſecundae qu</hi> 91. <hi>art.</hi> 2. <hi>ad.</hi> 4. <hi>Veteri durae cervicis &amp; ſtupidae mentis populo Deus olim indulſit.

And then why ſhould we not have Trumpets in the Worſhip of God as well as Organs? for the Jews had Trumpets alſo. And why muſt we have them only in Cathedral Churches, and in the Kings Chappel, ſeeing there is no preeminence or difference of places under the New Teſtament?

            <p>Thoſe Muſitians of old among the Jews, as Mr. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>were all Levites, and had a ſpecial Function and Calling in that Church by Gods appointment, whereupon they were wholly to attend, and whereunto they were enabled by ſpecial Gifts received from God.

            <p>But Chriſt hath left no direction to us about any ſuch Officers in the Churches of the New Teſtament: we read of Paſtors, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Elders and Deacons, but of Choriſters and Singingmen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And if we ſay the Church may appoint them, this will open a gap for all humane Inventions, Prelates, Popes and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals came in at this door.

the Praiſe of God,</hi> we muſt briefly conſider this Objection alſo. Now the Anſwer to it is in two words; If it be meant (as it ſeems to be) of true ſpiritual Delight and Devotion, the Aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that Organs in the Worſhip of God have any ſuch virtue. But if it be meant of meer natural Delight, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is falſe and feeble, <hi>viz.</hi> that therefore they may be uſed in the Worſhip of God.</p>

               <q>It is moſt apparent (ſaith he) that that ſame Church-chaunting and thoſe bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in our Temples, which alſo the very Prieſts themſelves do not underſtand, is a moſt fooliſh and vain abuſe, and a moſt pernicious let and hindrance to true Piety.</q>

               <hi>Magis animum movent ad delectationem, quam ut per ea formetur interius bona diſpoſitio,</hi> they do rather ſtir up the mind to delight, then frame it to a right diſpoſition, they raiſe natural rather then true ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual joy. And ſo that intelligent and learned Gentleman Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> obſerves, concerning the Popiſh Worſhip, that <q>being not underſtood by the people, it is not able to hold them with any ſpiritual content, their Service being no other then as a Lamp put out, which bringeth no Light at all to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, can neither bring any due warmth to the affections, the one being inſeparable from the other. And were it not that their Muſick, Perfumes, and rich Sights did hold the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senſes with their natural delight, ſurely it could not be
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:96313:307"/>
but either abandoned for the fruitleſneſs, or only upon fear and conſtraint frequented.</q> Sir <hi>E. S. of the State of Religion in the Weſtern parts, pag.</hi> 7, 8. We ſee then, that in the Judgments of all theſe learned men, Muſical inſtruments in the Worſhip of God tend rather to affect the Senſes and tickle the Ear with natural and ſenſual delight, then to edifie the Soul and raiſe the Heart, unto any true ſpiritual delight and rejoycing in the Lord.</p>
            <p>And whether their witneſs be not true, let the Scriptures of Truth judge. For Experience muſt be brought to the Scripture, as the Example to the Rule, and if it ſwerve from that Rule, it is but the corrupt experience of a deceived heart. But that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alledgeth, of Devotion raiſed by Muſical inſtruments in the Worſhip of God, is conrary to the Scriptures. For it is an everlaſting Scripture-truth, and a Rule as ſure as Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> that the Inventions of men are ſit for nothing but to deaden the heart and quench the affections, but they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver raiſe them, nor kindle one ſpark of any true ſpiritual affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Soul. <hi>The graven Image is profitable for nothing,</hi> Iſai. 44.10. <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men,</hi> Matth. 15.9. Hence when a blind Papiſt weeps over the Crucifix, and his heart is melted into Tears, he doth but bedabble it with carnal tears, as ſome have well expreſſed it. For what God hath not appointed he doth not, he will not own and bleſs. But this inſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhip of God is an Invention of Man; it is ſuch an help to Devotion as God hath not appointed: therefore it cannot raiſe the heart, nor kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle one ſpark of true devotion and ſpiritual affection in the Soul: So that the Aſſumption is utterly falſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Conſequence alſo is falſe and vain. For although there be a civil uſe of Muſick for lawful delight, to exhilerate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the Spirits, about which there is no controverſie; for I know none that queſtions it, and that this uſe of it, and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by it, ought to be improved to the Glory and Praiſe of God, is a thing beyond all diſpute; yet this is no ſufficient ground for the uſe of it in the Worſhip of God. For all the lawful Enjoyments and Comforts and Contentments of this life,
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:96313:308"/>
are in this ſenſe helps for the exhilarating of the Spirits to the Glory and Praiſe of God, <hi>whatever ye do, whether ye eat or drink do all to the Glory and Praiſe of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.31. ſo when we reſt and ſleep, a gracious Heart knows how to do every thing for this great end; but doth it therefore follow that men may ſleep at Church? I hope not. To ſee <hi>Boys and Girls playing in the ſtreets of</hi> Jeruſalem, will doubtleſs much exhilerate and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſpirits of their godly Parents to praiſe God, when that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhall be fulfilled, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.5. but doth it therefore follow that Boys may play at Church? So here, the application is eaſie. And therefore <hi>Pareus</hi> having ſhewed that the end of Muſical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is <hi>vel delectare vel excitare animum,</hi> he thus preoccupates this Objection, <q>But it is a ſimple thing (ſaith he) for any man to think, from this to defend the uſe of Organs in the Worſhip of God. For the Soul is to be raiſed up to God and ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, in the Church and publick Aſſemblies not by Pipes &amp; Trumpets, which God indulged of old to that ſtiff-necked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but by the preaching of the Word, the ſinging of Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Hinc vero Organorum uſum in Templis velle defendere ineptum eſt. In Eccleſia enim excitandus eſt animus ad Deum &amp; laetitiam ſpiritualem, non Tibiis, Tubis, Tympanis, qaod veteri durae cervicis &amp; ſtupidae mentis populo Deus olim indulſit, ſed ſacris Concionibus, Pſalmodiis, &amp; Hymnis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe ſolemn Caveats therefore before-mentioned againſt the abuſe of this Cathedral Muſick, are to as much purpoſe as the waſhing of a Blackamore to change his colour. <hi>For who can bring a clean thing out of that which is unclean?</hi> The thing it ſelf being ſinful and unlawful, it is not capable of any Regulation, but requires an utter Extirpation and rooting out. Such Counſels as theſe, againſt abuſe of that which is ſinful, are not unlike the Laws made by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, in the times of Popiſh Profaneneſs and Darkneſs, for the Regulation of Stews and Whorehouſes, as that <hi>no Stewholder ſhould receive any mans Wife, nor keep any Woman againſt her Will, if out of remorſe of Conſcience ſhe would leave that leud life,</hi> &amp;c. upon which a late Hiſtorian well obſerves, <q>that ſuch Canons and Conſtitutions could not
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:96313:308"/>
make them who were bad in themſelves to be good, though they might happily keep ſome who were bad,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Fullers Hiſtory of the Church, book <hi>5.</hi> pag. <hi>240.</hi>
                  </note> from being worſe. For though natural Poyſons may by art be ſo qualified and corrected, to make them cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial; yet moral Poyſons, <hi>viz.</hi> things ſinful of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves can never be ſo ordered and regulated, but that ſtill they will remain ſinful and unlawful, the only way to order and amend being to remove and extirpate them.</q> And therefore King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth did utterly ſuppreſs thoſe Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel-houſes. And the like courſe thoſe two and thirty grave learned men, who were choſen in King <hi>Edwards</hi> days to reform Eccleſiaſtical Laws and Obſervances, thought fit to take with this ſuperſtitious Muſick, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath gone a whoring after. <hi>Vibratam illam &amp; operoſam Muſicam quae figurata dicitur auferri placet. It likes us well</hi> (ſay they) <hi>to have this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and curious kind of Muſick quite taken away. De Divino Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiis ca.</hi> 5. <hi>apud Ameſium ubi ſupra.</hi> And the reformed Churches abroad have laid it aſide with one conſent, as hath been ſhewed; whereby it is evident, that they did not account it a good thing abuſed, but a thing ſinful and evil in it ſelf. So likewiſe the great Parliament in their Ordinance of <hi>May</hi> 9. 1644. in Mr. <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells Collection, Anno</hi> 1644. <hi>Ch.</hi> 38. thus reject them. <q>The Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament, the better to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the bleſſed Reformation ſo happily begun, and to remove all Offences and things illegal in the Worſhip of God, do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain— that all Organs, and Frames or Caſes wherein they ſtand, in all Churches and Chappels ſhall be taken away and utterly defaced, and none others hereafter ſet up in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces— whereunto all perſons within this Kingdom whom it may concern are hereby required at their peril to yield due o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bience.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have now examined all that I can meet with, that hath been objected in this Cauſe, and I know not what can be objected further, unleſs, being driven from all their other holds, they will fly for refuge to the Authority of the Church, as their manner is; which if they do, we may eaſily retort the Argument upon
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:96313:309"/>
themſelves, and beat them with their own weapons. If I held any Opinion according with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but contrary to the concurrent Judgment and Practice of all the choiſeſt Saints and pureſt Churches, I would even deſire the Lord to write it in Stars and Sun-beams. But ſuch is the Muſick now in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is borrowed from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and they who write for it borrow their Arguments from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes for it againſt <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> as hath been ſhewed; ſo that Papiſts and Semi-Proteſtants are almoſt the only Sticklers for it; but the reformed Churches have caſt it off; which though it is not in it ſelf a demonſtrative or cogent Argument, neither do I ſo intend it, fot the Scripture is the only infallible Judge; yet it is enough to confound and ſtop the mouths of ſuch Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, as pretend the Authority of the Church for this Chaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Idol-Service. For they take part with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this particular againſt all the Reformed Churches.</p>

               <p>WHereas the Author in the foregoing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe aſſerts that the Reformed Churches have with one conſent laid aſide Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſick in the Worship of God, that word <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> is not to be underſtood as includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either the Lutheran Churches abroad, or our Prelatick ones at home.

But theſe men who glory in their own Conformity to the publick Eſtablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can thus notoriouſly tranſgreſs it themſelves, and their Lordships the Bishops can connive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at in ſuch an inſtance as this. When any of the Conforming Clergy shall be as forward to ſwerve from the publick Eſtablishment on the other hand, in a way of departure from the Popish manner of Worship, as they are in this, to tranſgreſs againſt it in a way of approach to the Papiſts mode: we shall ſee whether their Lordships the Bishops will be as indulgent towards them or not. In the mean time, we may take it for granted that the King

               <p>THe <hi>perpetual Statutes</hi> of the Ceremonial Law we referred to five Heads. (1.) The initiating Seal of Circumciſion. (2.) The Legal Sacrifices and Purifications. (3.)

The Legal Feſtivals, or legal times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Four of theſe five Heads we have ſpoken to.

               <p>The fifth thing remaining to be ſpoken to, is the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> or the whole <hi>Legal Miniſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the Prieſthood and Legal Miniſtry we may conſider.</p>

               <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, there were three ſorts and degrees of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Officers.
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:96313:312"/>
1. The Prieſts, the chief of which was the High Prieſt. 2. The Levites. 3. The Nethinims.</p>
               <p>Now firſt of the Prieſthood.</p>
               <p>Three Doctrines are obvious before us in the words.</p>
               <p>Doct. 1. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God is the great High Prieſt, of whom the Prieſts under the Law were but types and ſhadows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doctr. 2. <hi>That he is paſſed into the Heavens, as the High Prieſt of old did into the holy places made with hands, ſo Chriſt into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doctr. 3. <hi>That our having ſuch an High Prieſt under the Goſpel, ſhould be an effectual motive to Believers to hold faſt their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As times of Proſperity to the Church uſe to produce many Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites: ſo times of Perſecution commonly produce many Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates: as it was formerly ſo it is now in this regard. Therefore a great part of the ſcope of this Epiſtle is, to perſwade them to hold faſt their Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>It is the firſt of theſe we are to ſpeak unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God is the great High Prieſt, of whom the Prieſts under the Law were but types and ſhadows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhall endeavour to open this a little, and give you the meaning of this Type, the Prieſthood under the Law, and that under two heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What of Chriſt was typified by the Prieſts, and eſpecially by the High Prieſt of old.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How or wherein did the High Prieſt typifie and ſhadow forth theſe things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. What of Chriſt was typified by the Prieſts, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the High Prieſts under the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Take it in three things, the legal Prieſthod was a Type,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of Chriſt himſelf, in his own Perſon. 2. In his Miniſters. 3. In his Members. All which I ſhall endeavour to make out unto you, with what evidence of Scripture-light the Lord ſhall enable me; when we come to the particulars wherin the High Prieſt did typifie and ſhadow forth Chriſt, there will be occaſion
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:96313:312"/>
to accommodate them all theſe ways, both to Chriſt, to himſelf, and his Miniſters and his Members.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Prieſt was a Type of Chriſt himſelf in his own perſon: therefore Chriſt is ſo often called <hi>a Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>an High Prieſt,</hi> eſpecially in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> And he doth appear, and is preſented unto <hi>John</hi> as officiating in the Office of a Prieſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. <hi>and another Angel came and ſtood at the Altar, having a Golden Cenſer, and there was given him much Incenſe.</hi> This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel is Jeſus Chriſt the great High Prieſt of his Church, who ſtands with the Golden Cenſer, having much Incenſe given him, that he ſhould offer it up before the Throne. Here is Jeſus Chriſt doing that great part of his Prieſtly Office, namely mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Interceſſion for us. For the Incenſe was a Type of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, as we have heard. This is the firſt thing typified by the High Prieſt, the Prieſt was a Type of Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Prieſts were Types of Goſpel-Miniſters, we read <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.3. <hi>He ſhall fit as a Refiner and Purifier of Silver, and he ſhall purifie the Sons of</hi> Levi, &amp;c. It is ſpoken concerning Jeſus Chriſt, when he ſhould come, what he ſhould do, and the meaning is, he ſhall ſet up a pure Goſpel-Miniſtry. In the laſt Chapters of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> as the holy City there, is the Church of God under the Goſpel: ſo the Prieſts and Levites are the Miniſters and Officers of the Church. And in that famous Propheſie of the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Gentiles, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.19, 20, 21. as the converted Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are here called a <hi>Meat-offering to the Lord:</hi> ſo Goſpel-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are called <hi>Prieſts and Levites,</hi> ver. 21. See the <hi>Geneva</hi> Notes e, f, g, h. on the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Here then it may be demanded, whether Goſpel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may be called Prieſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the Popiſh ſenſe they may not: for the Papiſts call them Prieſts, becauſe, they ſay, they offer a propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Maſs for quick and dead. But there is no ſuch Sacrifice under the Goſpel, but that one only Sacrifice which Jeſus Chriſt offered when he offered up himſelf once for all. Therefore their calling Miniſters Prieſts on ſuch an account is erroneous and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable.
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:96313:313"/>
And hence it is, that the word <hi>Prieſt</hi> is juſtly become a word of contempt and reproach, as the word <hi>Baal,</hi> which at firſt was and might be uſed for the true God; but becoming in common and ordinary ſpeech the name of Idols, the Lord refuſeth that Title, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.16. <hi>thou ſhalt no more call me</hi> Baali, <hi>my Lord, but thou ſhalt call me</hi> Iſhi. Or as the word <hi>Biſhop,</hi> which is a Scripture word, and ſignifieth an Overſeer, any Elder of a Church; but having been ſo long abuſed to ſignifie an Antichriſtian Order of men, and ſpiritual Uſurpers in the Church of God, it is now juſtly become a word of contempt and reproach: and therefore it is not ſit to call a Goſpel-Miniſter <hi>a Biſhop.</hi> Of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the word <hi>Catholick,</hi> which in its proper ſignification, and its firſt uſe, might be innocent and inoffenſive: but being become the name of diſtinction, whereby the Papiſts do diſtinguiſh themſelves from other Chriſtians that are more reformed then they; therefore we do not call our ſelves <hi>Catholicks,</hi> as they do.</p>
               <p>Some alledge, that the word Prieſt comes from the Saxon <hi>Preiſter,</hi> and that from the Greek <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and ſo ſignifies no more but an Elder. But the ſignification of words is not ruled by the Notation or Etymology of them: and therefore ſuppoſe this word Prieſt had ſome good ſenſe at firſt; yet being in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpeech uſed to ſignifie one that offers Sacrifice; it is therefore not ſit to be uſed concerning Goſpel-Miniſters, unleſs with ſome limitation and explication, as if we call them <hi>Antitypical Prieſts,</hi> or the like.</p>
               <p>The analogy lies chiefly in this; That as the Prieſts of old did miniſter to the Lord in his Houſe under the Law, ſo do Goſpel-Officers under the New Teſtament in his Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Prieſts were Types of all Believers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. <hi>and he hath made us Kings and Prieſts to God and his Father:</hi> ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. where he ſpeaks to all Believers and ſaith, <hi>But ye are a choſen Generation, a royal Prieſthood,</hi> &amp;c. all Believers are holy Prieſts unto God. The analogy lies chiefly in this; that as the Prieſts of old did offer legal Sacrifices, ſo Believers offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices under the Goſpel: the Apoſtle ſo explains
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:96313:313"/>
it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Ye alſo as lively ſtones are built up a ſpiritual Houſe, an holy Prieſthood to offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Theſe ſpiritual Sacrifices are Prayer and Praiſe and Thankſgiving, and univerſal Obedience to all Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Theſe are ſpiritual, acceptable Sacrifices, by Jeſus Chriſt, which Believers offer up now, as the Prieſts did typical Sacrifices under the Law. We ſee then that the Prieſts under the Law were Types of Jeſus Chriſt, of Goſpel-Miniſters, and of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. How or wherein did the Prieſts typifie Chriſt <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a large field. I ſhall endeavour to ſhew how and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Prieſts under the Law did ſhadow forth the things relating to Jeſus Chriſt under the Goſpel, and that in four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In their perſonal Qualifications, and other ritual obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions belonging to this Rank and Order of men. 2. In their Apparel. 3. In their Conſecration. 4. In their Prieſtly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations in the Houſe of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In their perſonal qualifications and ſpecial obſervations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Order of Prieſthod, ſome whereof did fit them for the Office, and the reſt were Rules to be obſerved by them in their Office. There were ſundry legal and typical qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and obſervations required in thoſe Ranks and Orders of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There were certain common and moral qualifications, which it is not neceſſary to ſeek a typical accommodation of; as that they ſhould be knowing and godly men, as Goſpel-Miniſters ought to be. But there were ſundry other qualifications, which had a typical reſpect, which were partly to fit them for their Office, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Rules to be obſerved by them in that Office and Order. I put them all together for the greater plainneſs and brevity ſake, though they might be ranked under two diſtinct heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Prieſt muſt be taken from amongſt his Brethren. 2. He is ſubject to common infirmities. 3. Yet free from groſs deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and blemiſhes. 4. Called of God, he muſt be called to this Office. 5. He muſt abſtain from Wine, he muſt drink no Wine. 6. He muſt not marry a Widow. 7. Nor mourn for the dead. Theſe things did point out ſomething relating to Jeſus Chriſt and Goſpel Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="622" facs="tcp:96313:314"/>1. The Prieſt muſt be taken from among his Brethren, from among the Jews: ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks and applies it, as having ſomething of myſtery in reference hereunto, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1. <hi>For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry High Prieſt taken from amongst men is ordained in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God.</hi> He was to be taken from amongſt themſelves. And truly ſo was Jeſus Chriſt: He is not taken from among Angels, but from among men; <hi>he took not on him the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. This is one thing; and it is a ſhadow and an intimation of Jeſus Chriſt his being of our nature, of humane nature: For otherwiſe he had not been a fit Mediator between God and Man, if he had not partaked of our nature, he could not have redeemed us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the Prieſt was taken from amongſt his Brethren, ſo he was ſubject to the common infirmities of his Brethren: he had (as is ſaid of the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi>) the ſame paſſions and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that his Brethren had. This is applied to Jeſus Chriſt, who took upon him not only our Nature, but the ſinleſs infirmities of pain, hunger, wearineſs and other ſufferings which we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to: ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>For we have not an High Prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without ſin,</hi> Hebr. 4.15. the next words after the Text: ſo in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1, 2. <hi>For every High Prieſt taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, that he may offer both Gifts and Sacrifices for Sin, who can have compaſſion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way, for that he himſelf is alſo compaſſed with infirmity</hi>— having experience and ſenſe of the ſame infirmity in himſelf, he knows how to have compaſſion on others. This relates to Jeſus Chriſt, who is a merciful High Prieſt expoſed to the ſame temptations and paſſions with us, though without ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Prieſt muſt be free from groſs deformities and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, though he was ſubject to common humane infirmities, <hi>Lev.</hi> 21 17. <hi>Say unto</hi> Aaron <hi>whoſoever it is that hath any blemiſh, let him not approach to offer Sacrifice; for whatſoever man it is that hath any blemiſh, he ſhall not approach, a blind, or lame, or broken-footed, or broken-handed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he ſhall not come to offer the Offering of
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:96313:314"/>
the Lord made by fire, he hath a blemiſh, he ſhall not come nigh to offer the Bread of his God.</hi> Theſe natural infirmities which the Prieſts under the Law muſt be free from, taught us the abſolute freedom of Jeſus Chriſt from moral infirmities, there is no ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, no ſpot found in him: He wants no parts, no gifts or ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to diſcharge his whole Office and Function. <hi>For ſuch an High Prieſt becomes us, who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, and made higher then the Heavens,</hi> Heb. 7.26. as they were to be free from thoſe natural blemiſhes and defects: ſo is Jeſus Chriſt free from all ſinful defects and blemiſhes. That is a third Rule as to the qualifications of the Prieſts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They muſt be called unto this Office, and muſt not intrude and thruſt themſelves into it. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>take</hi> Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron <hi>and his Sons with him from among the people, that they may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter unto me in the Prieſts Office.</hi> Exod. 28.1. The Apoſtle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies this alſo to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5. he doth not take this honour to himſelf; as no man ſhould take the honour of the Prieſthood to himſelf, but he that was called, as was <hi>Aaron:</hi> ſo Jeſus Chriſt was called of God the Father to this Office, as the Prieſts were by <hi>Moſes</hi> to their Levitical Miniſtry. Chriſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied not himſelf to be made High Prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou art my Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The Prieſt muſt abſtain from the uſe of Wine and Strong Drink when he is to do the Service of God in the Sanctuary, and to miniſter before the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.9. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>ſaying, do not drink Wine nor Strong Drink, thou nor thy Sons with thee, when ye go into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, leſt he die,</hi> &amp;c. ſo it is ſaid in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.21. <hi>neither ſhall any Prieſt drink Wine when they enter into the inner Court.</hi> The end of this was, that they might be ſure to adminiſter and execute their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice aright, <hi>leſt they drink and forget the Law,</hi> Prov. 31.5. <hi>leſt they ſhould err through Wine, and be out of the way through Strong drink, and ſtumble in Judgment.</hi> Iſai. 28.7. <hi>Whoredom and Wine, and new Wine take away the heart.</hi> Hoſ. 4.11. Thus they were to abſtain from the uſe of Wine and Strong drink.</p>
               <p>This repreſents that undiſturbed Sobriety and Wiſdom of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:96313:315"/>
Chriſt in the whole execution of his Office, as the great High Prieſt of his Church. He was never forgetful of, or unready for any part of his Office, but he had clearneſs of Judgment and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at all times.</p>
               <p>So the Miniſters of the Goſpel, there is a ſecondary applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe things to them, though firſt and chiefly it is applied to Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. Whatſoever is ſet forth concerning Jeſus Chriſt, doth ſecondarily point at Miniſters and Chriſtians, in whom the Graces and Excellencies of Jeſus Chriſt appear. The Miniſters of the Goſpell muſt be ſober, and not men given to Wine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. <hi>A Biſhop muſt not be given to Wine, no ſtriker, or given to filthy lucre,</hi> &amp;c. and the Apoſtle requires it alſo in other places, that they ſhould take heed of that ſin, they muſt be ſober and watchful in all things, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. <hi>But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an Evangeliſt, make full proof of thy Miniſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So all Believers likewiſe, (for it belongs likewiſe to them) they ſhould be ſober, and watch to the diſcharge of their Chriſtian duty: <hi>Be ye therefore ſober,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.7. <hi>and watch unto Prayer,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8. <hi>be ſober, be vigilant; becauſe your adverſary the Devil, as a roaring Lion, walketh about, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a woful thing and a ſhameful thing, when Miniſters are given to Wine and Strong drink; theſe are not Gods Miniſters, theſe are ſuch as do not correſpond with the <hi>Type.</hi> And it is the fruit of the Wrath of God upon a people; when he ſets up ſuch Miniſters among them, <hi>Mich.</hi> 2.11. <hi>If any man ſhall propheſie of Wine or of Strong drink, he ſhall be the Prophet to this people,</hi> Iſai. 56.10, 11, 12. <hi>his Watchmen are blind, they are ignorant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>come, ſay they, we will fetch Wine and fill our ſelves with Strong drink, and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</hi> It is uſually the prologue and introduction to great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations or Land-devouring Judgments, when they have Prieſts that love Wine and Strong drink, it brings Land-devouring Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And that is a fifth Rule concerning theſe Levitical Prieſts, that they muſt abſtain from Wine and Strong drink when they were to miniſter before the Lord.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="625" facs="tcp:96313:315"/>6. The Prieſt might not marry a Widow, or a divorced Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or a Harlot, but a Virgin of his people. This is another peculiar obſervation required of men in that Order under the Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 21.13, 14. <hi>And he ſhall take a Wife in her Virginity: a Widow or a divorced Woman, or profane, or an Harlot, theſe ſhall he not take, but he ſhall take a Virgin of his own people to Wife,</hi> &amp;c. The ſame thing is ſpoken alſo in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.22. <hi>neither ſhall they take to wife a Widow,</hi> &amp;c. What is the meaning of this? it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a moral precept. It is not unlawful for a Miniſter to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Widow. Therefore look at the High Prieſt herein. The Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt ought to be a Virgin, chaſte and undefiled, whoſe firſt and beſt Love is to be beſtowed on him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>I am jealous over you with godly Jealouſie, for I have eſpouſed you to one Husband, that I may preſent you as a chaſte Virgin to Chriſt.</hi> And in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. we find that Profeſſors in ſome reſpects, they are all Virgins, though there be fooliſh Virgins as well as wife: but it is eſpecially applied to the ſincere, to the wiſe Virgins— <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Theſe are they that are not defiled with Women, for they are Virgins; theſe follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth.</hi> Purity and Holineſs is the property of true Believers: an entire dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themſelves to Jeſus Chriſt alone. <hi>The Virgins love thee. Cant.</hi> 1.3.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſeventh Rule and Obſervation about the Prieſthood was this, that he was not to mourn for the dead, no not for his Father and Mother; nor to attend their Funeral, or to go out of the Sanctuary to intermit his Miniſtry, <hi>Lev.</hi> 21.10, 11, 12. <hi>And he that is the High Prieſt among his Brethren, he ſhall not uncover his head, nor rent his clothes; neither ſhall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himſelf for his Father or for his Mother: neither ſhall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane the Sanctuary of his God, for the Crown of the Anointing Oil is upon him, I am the Lord.</hi> What is the meaning of this? <hi>he ſhall not defile himſelf for the dead?</hi> Doubtleſs natural affections were not forbidden, the Prieſts were not to be Stoicks and brute Beaſts. But it teacheth us, that the Prieſt was to have more regard to the duty of his Function, then to any natural paſſions or affections whatſoever,
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:96313:316"/>
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.9. This was eminently fulfilled in Jeſus Chriſt, who did not lay aſide any due or ſeaſonable reſpect to his natural Relations. A reſpect he had for them, as appears by his Care of his Mother when he was on the Croſs committing her to <hi>John;</hi> but this was no unſeaſonable reſpect or regard of her: But we find alſo that <hi>he was diſputing in the Temple,</hi> Luke 2.48, 49. at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on the work of his Miniſtry, and not attending on his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother; and in <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.46, <hi>&amp;c. his Mother and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> (or Kindred) <hi>they ſtood without, deſiring to ſpeak with him: But he anſwered, ſhould not I be about my Fathers buſineſs? who is my Mother and my Brethren,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whoſoever doth the will of my Father, the ſame is my Brother and Siſter and Mother.</hi> He would not ſo attend on them, as to neglect the diſcharge and executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Office: He did not at any time uncover his head by any weakneſs, or inglorious paſſion or affection: He did not defile himſelf by familiar communion with defiling ſinners at any time; he did converſe with them ſometimes, but not ſo as to contract any pollution to himſelf: He is ſeparated from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he never touched any dead body with any defiling touch. And this ſame ſpirit of neglect of natural reſpects to Relations the Lord requires alſo of others, even of his Miniſters, and of all Believers in ſome caſes, and in ſome meaſure and degree. They muſt regard the work of God more then the comfort and ſweetneſs in the deareſt relations. <hi>Follow me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and let the dead bury the dead. He that loveth Father or Mother more then me, is not worthy of me.</hi> A man muſt hate Father and Mother, Wife and Children, and Brethren and Siſters, yea and his own Life alſo, elſe he cannot be Chriſts Diſciple. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. So <hi>Paul, Henceforth we know no man after the fleſh.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> When then is reſpect to Relations to be laid aſide?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Rule is this; when God by his Providence orders things ſo, as that it ſtands in competition with the duty we ow to God; when it is ſo, we are then in ſome ſenſe called to hate, that is, not to regard Father or Mother, Wife or Children, when our reſpects to them ſtand in competition with the duty we ow
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:96313:316"/>
to Chriſt. Every Believer is to do all this, as well as Jeſus Chriſt. So we ſee the antient Obſervations and Rules belonging to the Order of the Prieſthood of old; they had reſpect to the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt and his Saints and Miniſters under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The Prieſts alſo were <hi>Types of Chriſt</hi> in their Clothes and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and Conſecration to that Office. But of theſe things here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

               <p>Doct. <hi>That there were nine holy Garments inſtituted and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God for the High Prieſts of old, namely, the holy Coat, the Girdle, the Robe, the Ephod, the Girdle of the Ephod, the Breſt-plate, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim, the Mitre, and the Golden Plate.</hi>

               <p>Note theſe three things in general concerning them, and then I ſhall come to particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The general end and uſe of theſe Garments was to be <hi>for
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:96313:317" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Beauty and Glory,</hi> Exod. 28.2. as betokening an higher Glory and Beauty then meerly outward, even the Beauty of Holineſs; as a ſhadow of an higher ſpiritual Clothing (for the Scripture often ſpeaks of a ſpiritual Clothing) the taking away the guilt of ſin, and clothing the Soul with Chriſts Righteouſneſs, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Take away the filthy Garments from him, and unto him he ſaid, behold I have cauſed thine iniquity to paſs from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of Raiment.</hi> Pſal. 132.9, 16. <hi>Let thy Prieſts be clothed with Righteouſneſs, and let her Saints ſhout for joy— I will alſo clothe her Prieſts with Salvation, and her Saints ſhall ſhout aloud for joy</hi>— Job 29.14. <hi>I put on Righteouſneſs and it clothed me; my Judgment was as a Robe and a Diadem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are called <hi>holy Garments,</hi> Exod 28.2— and often elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: but a Garment is not capable of inherent Holineſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be meant in regard of their uſe and ſignification.

               <p n="2">2. The materials whereof they were made, were theſe five, Gold, blue, purple, ſcarlet, and fine Linnen. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.5. Some of them had all theſe ingredients; there was none of them, but had ſome of theſe. Gold is coſtly and ſumptuous, Linnen is a white and clean clothing, the reſt have ſomething of a bloody co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: all of them together are thought to repreſent, and to be a dark umbrage of the preciouſneſs and glory of the true High Prieſt, both in his Sufferings and in his Graces.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the number and order of them, they are reckoned up and deſcribed at large in <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. and cap. 39. And being ſo largely ſpoken to, almoſt two whole Chapters ſpent upon them by the ſpirit of God, beſide other briefer mention of them in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures; we may ſafely conclude, that there is much of ſpiritual uſe and myſtery, and meaning in them. For it cannot enter into a Chriſtian heart to think or imagine, that the Holy Ghoſt would imploy two Chapters of Scripture in a thing of nought.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. ver. 4. <hi>the Breſt plate is named firſt, according to the order of Dignity, that being the chief of all.</hi> But in <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:96313:317" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>they are mentioned in the order of putting them on,</hi> and here there are <hi>nine mentioned:</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.5, 6. there are <hi>ſeven:</hi> but in <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.4. there are but <hi>ſix.</hi> Which various enumerations of them are eaſily reconciled, becauſe ſome Garments are ſometimes implied and included in others; as the Urim and Thummim in the Breſt-plate, the Golden Plate in the Mitre. And whereas there were two Girdles, the one of them is ſometimes omitted, they being both the ſame in uſe and ſignification. I ſhall ſpeak to them as they are ſet down in this 8th of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> becauſe there I find the moſt compleat and explicit enumeration of them all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and diſtinctly. And there are nine particulars here e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerated.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is the embroidered Coat of fine Linnen, of which <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. ver. 39. called <hi>the embroidered Coat.</hi> It was not of plain Linnen, as the reſt of the Prieſts, but of <hi>Linnen curiouſly wrought.</hi> We tranſlate it embroidered, or wrought Diaper-like, with Chequer-work, or ſome ſuch adorning. This embroidered Coat was a long Linnen garment, it came down to his feet. That which Antichriſt retains and uſeth under the name of a <hi>Surplice,</hi> is taken from hence, if it have its riſe from any thing in Scripture: though ſome think the original of it is from Paganiſh Superſtition, the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſts uſing ſuch a Garment. Perhaps the Devil brought it in among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> in a deviliſh imitation of this Inſtitution of Gods. However at beſt to fetch our <hi>Surplice</hi> from hence is as fooliſh, as if Miniſters ſhould hang Bells at their skirts, becauſe <hi>Aaron</hi> did ſo.</p>
               <p>Perſons of eminent worth and excellency were wont of old to be clothed in fine Linnen; as <hi>Joſeph</hi> upon his advancement, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.42. Pharaoh <hi>arrayed him in veſtures of fine Linnen.</hi> Chriſt appears in ſuch an habit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.13. <hi>and in the midſt of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Candleſticks I ſaw one like unto the Son of man clothed with a Garment down to the foot, and girt about the Paps with a Golden Girdle.</hi> It is an evident alluſion to the Garments of the High Prieſt. He hath a Viſion of Jeſus Chriſt as the great High Prieſt of his Church walking in the Sanctuary; (for there ſtood the Golden Candleſticks,) and clothed and apparelled in Prieſtly
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:96313:318" rendition="simple:additions"/>
attire. The myſtical ſignification of this Garment is the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, not only in regard of his own perſon, but alſo wherewith he clothes Believers. Chriſt being in this and other places deſcribed not ſo much in what he is abſolutely in himſelf, but what he is relatively to and for his people. <hi>vid. Brightman on Rev.</hi> 1.13. Therefore the Saints themſelves are deſcribed and preſented in the like habit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9, 13, 14— <hi>Theſe are they which came out of great tribulation, and have waſhed their Robes, and made them white, in the Blood of the Lamb,</hi> that is, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. It is yet more expreſly explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.8. <hi>and to her was granted, that ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine Linnen, clean and white, for the fine Linnen is the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Saints.</hi> There is a twofold Righteouſneſs, both which may be here included.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a Righteouſneſs inherent in Chriſt, and imputed to Believers. This is <hi>the Righteouſneſs of Juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a Righteouſneſs inherent in Believers, but derived from Chriſt: and this is <hi>the Righteouſneſs of Sanctification.</hi> Some have called them <hi>the upper Garment of Juſtification,</hi> and <hi>the inner Garment of Sanctification.</hi> They are both mentioned, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.13. <hi>the Kings Daughter is all glorious within,</hi> and ver. 14. <hi>ſhe is brought to the King in a Garment of Needle-work:</hi> the meaning is, the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Garment of Juſtification, and the under Garment of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Beleivers therefore who are ſpiritual Prieſts, they ſhould not clothe themſelves with the filthy rags of their own Righteouſneſs, nor with the rotten Garments of counterfeit Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as Hypocrites and Juſticiaries do; but get on this Prieſtly attire, ſeek it of Chriſt, <hi>Rev</hi> 3.18. it is promiſed— <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.4, 5. your Faith ſhould rejoice and triumph in it. See <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Girdle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. ver. 39. <hi>and thou ſhalt make the Girdle of Needle-work, Exod.</hi> 39. ver. 29. <hi>and a Girdle of fine twined Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, and blue, and purple, and ſcarlet of Needle-work, as the Lord commanded</hi> Moſes: So Chriſt, as the great High Prieſt, appeareth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.13. <hi>girt about the Paps with a Golden Girdle:</hi> And Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have a ſpiritual Girdle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.14. <hi>having your Loins girt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with truth.</hi> This legal ſhadow the Popiſh Prieſts retain,
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:96313:318" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and call it a <hi>Canonical Girdle.</hi> The Girdle imports three things. (1.) Truth. (2.) Strength. (3.) Readineſs for action. All, both in Chriſt and Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Truth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.14. Truth ſhould ſit cloſe to the heart, like a Girdle about the Body: ſo Chriſt, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Righteouſneſs ſhall be the Girdle of his Loins, and Faithfulneſs the Girdle of his Reins.</hi> Many Profeſſors when the Truth comes to be perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they do not gird it cloſe to them, but their Girdle hangs looſe about them, <hi>they are not valiant for Truth upon the earth. Jer.</hi> 9.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Strength, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 22.21. <hi>I will clothe him with thy Robe, and ſtrengthen him with thy Girdle.</hi> Prov. 31.17. <hi>She girdeth her loins with ſtrength.</hi> Therefore <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.27. <hi>their Girdle ſhall not be looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> that is, God will ſtrengthen them to be the Executioners of his Wrath upon a ſinful people; <hi>None ſhall be weary or ſtumble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them; none ſhall ſlumber nor ſleep, neither ſhall the Girdle of their loins be looſed.</hi> It ſignifieth therefore the Strength of Chriſt, and of Believers through him. They are weak in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but ſtrong in Chriſt, being girded with his Strength.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Readineſs for action, and expedition, and perſeverance therein for they uſing long Garments when they went about any buſineſs, they were wont to gird them up under their Girdle. Hence it is ſaid of <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 Kings 18. ult. <hi>and the hand of the Lord was on</hi> Elijah, <hi>and he girded up his loins and ran before</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab, &amp;c. and therefore the Angel ſaith to <hi>Peter, gird thy ſelf, and bind on thy Sandals,</hi> Acts 12.8. <hi>and follow me.</hi> And the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſaith to his Servant in the Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.8. <hi>gird thy ſelf and ſerve me:</hi> Chriſt is always <hi>in procinctu,</hi> girt about with his Golden Girdle, as ready for the work of his Office, to ſerve his Father, and to defend and mediate for his Church and People. And ſo ſhould the Saints, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.35. <hi>let your Loins be girded about, and your Lamps be lighted;</hi> that is, as Servants ready to ſerve and wait upon their Maſter, as it follows, ver. 36. <hi>and ye your ſelves like unto men that wait for their Lord,</hi> be in a ready poſture— 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. <hi>wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be ſober and hope to the end.</hi> As Chriſt was, ſo Miniſters and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:96313:319"/>
ſhould be always in readineſs to go about any buſineſs the Lord calls them to; they ſhould have their Girdle about them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Robe, <hi>called the Robe of the Ephod.</hi> Exod. 28.31. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was girded with the Ephod which was put next upon it; ſo <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Ainſworth in loc.</hi> This was made all of blue, ver. 31. it was not ſo long as the fine Linnen Coat beforementioned; for that came to the feet, but this to the knees, to the gar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ering place or thereabout. Of the ſuperſtitious Garments retained by Antichriſt, that which ſeems to come neereſt to it, is <hi>the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Coat,</hi> as they call it. The Jewiſh Writers ſay of this Robe, that it had no Sleeves, but was divided into two skirts, from the end of the neck unto beneath, after the manner of all Robes, and was not joyned together, but about all the neck only. <hi>Ainſworth on Exod.</hi> 28.32. It had a ſtrong binding or a welt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the neck, in Hebrew called a <hi>Lip,</hi> that it might not be rent. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.32. But that which is moſt remarkable in it, is the Golden Bells and Pomegranates that were upon the skirt thereof at the bottom of it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. ver. 33, 34, 35— <hi>that the ſound of the Bells may be heard</hi>—</p>
               <p>Let me ſpeak a little in the help of Chriſt to the myſtery of theſe ſacred Bells, and then to the Pomegranates.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Bells of the holy Robe.</hi> There be two things that ſeem to be clearly intimated and held forth thereby.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Voice of Chriſt in his Prayers and Mediation for us, which is heard of God, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.7. and 7.25. when he goes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the holy place, the ſound of theſe Golden Bells is heard of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Voice of Chriſt in the Goſpel, which is heard of his Church, the ſound thereof rings in his Church, yea throughout the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. <hi>their ſound went forth into all the world.</hi> And we may apply it in a ſecondary way to the Miniſters of Chriſt, thoſe Antitypical Prieſts. They ſhould be furniſhed with Golden Bells, the voice of Prayer, and the voice of Preaching; as the Prieſts of old, if the noiſe of theſe Bells was not heard, they dye, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.35. ſo it is ſpiritual death and deſtruction to the Soul: there is no hope of the Salvation of that Miniſter under
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:96313:319"/>
the Goſpel, that cannot, that doth not pray and preach. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. <hi>Neceſſity is laid upon me, wo is unto me, if I preach not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel;</hi> either preach or dye.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Pomegranates of the Robe;</hi> that is curious works upon the border of it, reſembling that fruit, and being an emblem there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The Pomegranate is a fruit ſweet and pleaſant to the taſte, and fragrant and delightful to the ſmell.</p>
               <p>Therefore it ſeems to ſhadow forth the ſweet refreſhing fruits and effects of the voice of Chriſt, both in his Mediation with the Lord, and the Preaching of his Goſpel in the Church. His Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation is not only ſhrill in the ears of the Lord; but alſo fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant in his Noſtrils <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. And the Goſpel of Chriſt hath not only a ſweet ſound, but a ſavory ſmell, and cordial refreſhing virtue to refreſh the heart. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15, 18. The Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth ſuch fruits, as are ſweet and ſavory: therefore the Church is compared to <hi>an Orchard of Pomegranates,</hi> Cant. 4.13. ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights Chriſt with them, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.2. they are delightful to Chriſt himſelf. It ſhould be thus with all the Miniſters of Chriſt, and in all the Churches of Chriſt; there ſhould be not only the ſound of the Golden Bells, but the pleaſant fruits of an holy life and converſation; elſe what good will the ſound do, if there be no fruits appearing, the Bells without the Pomegranates—</p>
               <p>And whereas there was an hole for the head to be put in, like the hole of an Habergeon. (An Habergeon is a Coat of Male, a piece of defenſive Armour, made of Iron Wyres woven and twiſted together, that it be not rent.) Chriſt is ſaid to put on that Garment, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.17. <hi>for he put on Righteouſneſs as a Breſt-plate,</hi> or as an Habergeon.</p>
               <p>Some accommodate it thus; That in the Coat of Chriſt there ſhould be no Rent, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.23, 24. but an unity of Doctrine, and good works, and fruits of Righteouſneſs amongſt his people. Though I confeſs this Metaphor of rending the ſeamleſs Coat of Chriſt, hath been weakly uſed and applyed by thoſe, that having nothing but the Coat amongſt them (as the Souldiers) for their own ends would not rend that, but make no ſcruple to rend and crucifie his bleſſed Body, no more then Papiſts do to martyr and
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:96313:320" rendition="simple:additions"/>
burn his Members, for which <hi>Luther</hi> in a juſt and holy ſcorn calls them <hi>Tunicaſtres.</hi> But as to this typical Garment ſuch an alluſion may be made.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Ephod,</hi> of which the expreſſion here is, <hi>And he put the Ephod upon him,</hi> Exod. 28.6. It was made of five materials, of Gold, blue, purple, ſcarlet and fine twined Linned. The Gold was firſt beaten into Plates, and then cut into Wyres, and then wrought and woven into, and among the other materials, <hi>Exod.</hi> 39.3. <hi>and they did beat the Gold into thin Plates, and cut it into Wyres, to work it in the blue, and in the purple,</hi> &amp;c. The word <hi>Ephod</hi> is from the verb <hi>Aphad, ſuperinduxit, cinxit,</hi> to clothe, or fitly to encompaſs with a Garment; from whence comes the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to fit. The <hi>Septuagint</hi> renders it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the vulgar Latine <hi>ſuperhumerale,</hi> a Garment upon the ſhoulders. Some render it <hi>Pallium:</hi> from whence came the word <hi>Pall,</hi> a Garment, taken as it ſeemeth from this, which the <hi>Pope</hi> was wont to ſend to an <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> for his Conſecration, or Inſtallment into his Office, as being the High Prieſt over all the Prieſts in ſuch a Province or Kingdom.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Ephod</hi> was (ſay our Annotators on <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.4.) a ſhort Coat without Sleeves, put upon his other Garments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o keep them cloſe together— It reached from the Shoulders to the Loins.</p>
               <p>There were two ſorts of Ephods uſed among the Jews, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and a ſacred Ephod.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was a <hi>common Ephod,</hi> which was not peculiar to the High Prieſt only, but to other Prieſts alſo; yea to others alſo that were not Prieſts: ſo 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.18. Doeg <hi>fell upon the Prieſts and ſlew that day eighty five perſons that did wear a Linnen Ephod.</hi> Yea it was not peculiar to Prieſts only, but common to others alſo who were not Prieſts: ſo we read of <hi>Samuel,</hi> that when he was a Child he wore a Linnen Ephod, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.18. though he was no Prieſt by Birth, but only a Levite. And <hi>David,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.14. was girded with a Linnen Ephod. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was a <hi>ſacred Ephod,</hi> which was peculiar to the High Prieſt only. The differences between this and the common Ephod were ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="635" facs="tcp:96313:320" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. That was made of Linnen; but this of ſundry other mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, Gold, blue, purple, and ſcarlet, and fine twined Linnen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This ſacred Ephod had a peculiar Ornament belonging to it, <hi>viz.</hi> the two <hi>Onyx ſtones</hi> upon the ſhoulder pieces of it, of which by and by.</p>
               <p n="3">3. None might imitate this, or make one like unto it, though of other matter, and for ordinary uſe they made Garments of that name and ſhape commonly called <hi>Ephods.</hi> It was the ſin and the fall of <hi>Gideons</hi> Houſe, that he made one like this, not an Ephod for ordinary wear, but <hi>a ſacred miniſtring Garment,</hi> Judg. 8.27, 33.</p>
               <p>As to the ſpiritual myſtery of this Garment, this <hi>holy Ephod</hi> of the High Prieſt, it appears chiefly in this. There were two ſhoulder-pieces belonging to it, in which were placed two Ouches of <hi>Gold,</hi> with two Onyx ſtones ſet and faſtened in them. <hi>Two Ouches</hi>] that is, hollow Circles, two hollow places in which the ſtones were ſet like Diamonds in a Ring. <hi>Onyx ſtones</hi>] white ſtones, not unlike the white of a mans Nail. The Hebrew word is <hi>Shoham.</hi> It is, I know, otherwiſe rendered by ſome: but the <hi>Onyx</hi> being a large ſtone, as it was requiſite that theſe ſhould be, that there might be ſpace enough to ingrave ſix names in a ſtone, (beſides other circumſtances) we may reſt in this Tranſlation.</p>
               <p>The uſe of theſe precious ſtones was for the writing of the names of the twelve Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in them, that the High Prieſt might bear them upon his ſhoulders for a memorial before the Lord. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.9, 10, 11, 12. Now the Prieſt being a Type of Chriſt, and the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> a Type of the whole Church of God; their being born thus upon the ſhoulders of the High Prieſt clothed with this <hi>ſacred Ephod,</hi> intimated three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt his ſupporting of his Church and people, and bearing them up, as upon the ſhoulders of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Grace and Government, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9.6. <hi>the Government ſhall be upon his ſhoulders:</hi> ſo he is ſaid to do with the loſt Sheep, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.5. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 46.3, 4. <hi>hearken unto me, O Houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>all the remnant of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which are born by me from the Belly,
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:96313:321"/>
which are carried from the Womb, and even to your old age, I am he, and even to hoary hairs I will carry you, I have made you, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. His preſenting them to the Lord, to be in everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance before him; that he cannot look upon the High Prieſt, but their names appear upon his ſhoulders for a memorial before the Lord: their names are engraven in his ſight, that he cannot look from off them— <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>A book of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance is written before him for them that fear the Lord,</hi> Epheſ. 5.27. <hi>that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He bears their names before the Lord in this curious and coſtly Ephod: as repreſenting his own perfect Righteouſneſs, wherewith he ſtands clothed before God, in the glorious merit whereof he appeareth for his people. For men to truſt to their own works and merits, is to have their names born before God in an Ephod of their own weaving, which God abhors; by which ſin both the Jews and the Papiſts periſh. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. But the Saints dare not appear before God in ſuch filthy Garments, but confeſs as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.6. <hi>All our Righteouſneſs is but as filthy rags,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>curious Girdle of the Ephod;</hi> of which the words of Text are theſe; <hi>And he girded him with the curious Girdle of the Ephod, and bound it unto him therewith,</hi> Exod. 28.8. ſo that this Girdle of the Ephod is thought not to be a diſtinct thing, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from the Ephod; but to have been as it were a piece of it. Mr. <hi>Ainſworths</hi> Note out of the Rabbins is this; <hi>The Ephod had as it were two hands or pieces going out from it in the weaving on this ſide, and on that, with the which they girded it: and they are called</hi> [Cheſeb] <hi>the curious Girdle of the Ephod. This curious Girdle of the Ephod was tyed upon his heart under the Breſt-plate. This differeth from the other Girdle</hi> [Abnet] <hi>which is after ſpoken of in ver.</hi> 39. <hi>and by reaſon of the Gold in this, which the other had not, it is called the</hi> Golden Girdle. Some have doubted whether there were two Girdles; but the Text is clear for it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.7. <hi>He put upon him the Coat, and girded him with the Girdle.</hi> This is <hi>the Linnen Girdle.</hi> Now it follows, <hi>and he clothed him with the Robe, and put the Ephod upon him, and he girded him with the
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:96313:321"/>
curious Girdle of the Ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.</hi> And they are called by two ſeveral names, <hi>Abnet</hi> and <hi>Cheſeb.</hi> The reaſon why there was two, was, becauſe his Garments did require two.</p>
               <p>As to the myſtery of this <hi>ſecond Girdle,</hi> it is the ſame with the former. It ſignified the truth and ſtrength and readineſs for action that is in Chriſt, and ſhould be in all that bear his name: ſo I need ſay no more upon it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſixth piece of the High Prieſtly attire, and indeed the chief of all, was <hi>the Breſt-plate,</hi> of which the Text ſaith, <hi>and he put the Breſt-plate upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning this holy Pectoral or Breſt-plate there be four things declared in <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. from ver. 15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ver. 29.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Materials of Gold, Blue, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> the ſame with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phod, ver. 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The form and ſhape, four-ſquare, a ſpan in breadth and length, ver. 16.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The twelve Stones, with the names of the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſet therein, ver. 17, to 22. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſet in it ſettings of Stones, even four rows of Stones,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The faſtening of the Breſt-plate to the Ephod by four Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Rings in the four corners of it. In the two upper Rings of the Breſt-plate there were two Chains of Gold, by which it was faſtened above to two Golden Ouches in the ſhoulder-pieces of the Ephod; and in the two lower Rings of the Breſt-plate there was a blue Lace, by which it was tyed to two Gold Rings in the ſides of the <hi>Ephod,</hi> ver. 22, to 29. <hi>that ſo the Breſt-plate might not be looſed from the Ephod,</hi> ver. 28. which may help in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of that place, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.9. where <hi>David</hi> ſaith to <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar</hi> the Prieſt, <hi>Bring hither the Ephod;</hi> that is, to conſult with the Lord by Urim and Thummim (ſaith the <hi>Geneva</hi> Note upon the place): for by the Providence of God the Ephod was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and kept with <hi>David</hi> the true King; that ſo he might have the means of conſulting with God in all his dangers and diſtreſſes: and the Breſt-plate wherein was the Urim and Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim, by which they inquired of God, was faſtened to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phod,
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:96313:322"/>
and not to be looſened from it: ſo that <hi>David</hi> called for the Ephod, becauſe of the Breſt-plate that was faſtened to it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Urim and Thummim that was in the Breſt-plate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why is it called <hi>Pectorale Judicii, the Breſt-plate of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> ſo <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. ver. 15, 29, 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There may be a twofold account given of this. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the High Prieſt was to wear this upon his Breſt, when he gave forth a Sentence and Judgment from God unto ſuch as came to him to inquire of God by him. 2. The Judgment of the Children of Iſrael may be underſtood to ſignifie the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of their Good; for Judgment is not always put for Wrath and Puniſhment, but for a wiſe and accurate and exact Adminiſtration of things; <hi>ſaepe per nomen Miſhpat Scriptura ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat quicquid bene &amp; rite ordinatum eſt— Hoc Epitheto commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur rectus &amp; omni vitio purus Ordo, Calvin. in Exod.</hi> 28.4.30. So <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.39. <hi>For Judgment am I come into this world, that they that ſee not, might ſee;</hi> this is no act of Puniſhment, but of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; yet called Judgment: ſo it is propheſied of Chriſt, <hi>Iſai</hi> 42.3, 4. <hi>that he ſhall bring forth Judgment unto truth,</hi> and <hi>ſhall not fail nor be diſcouraged, till he have ſet Judgment in the earth,</hi> that is, he ſhall not faint nor be diſcouraged, till he hath gone through with the work of their Salvation, and ſet in order all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of it; that wiſe and prudent and judicious adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things by Jeſus Chriſt, whereby he rectifies, repairs and ſets in good order the confuſed and collapſed eſtate of his Church and people: inſomuch that all the concernments of their eternal good are ſet ſtrait, brought to their beſt conſtitution, and carried on in a moſt exact and regular manner, with admirable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom—. That as they, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. <hi>ult.</hi> were beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure aſtoniſhed, and they ſaid, <hi>he hath done all things well:</hi> ſo ſhall all the Saints ſay, when they underſtand and review the ways that Chriſt hath walked in for their Salvation. <hi>Aaron</hi> did here repreſent this typically, in this <hi>Pectorale Judicii,</hi> this <hi>Breſt-plate of Judgment:</hi> But Chriſt hath performed, and done it really and indeed.</p>
               <p>To unfold the myſtery of theſe things a little more particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="639" facs="tcp:96313:322" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. The Precious Stones, with the Names of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſignifie all the Saints, the whole Church and people of God. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a typical people: therefore the whole Church of God is called <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Gal. 6.16. <hi>As many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them and mercy, and upon (or even upon) the</hi> Iſrael <hi>of God.</hi> Hence the ſame Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth of outward Jews and inward Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. two laſt. And Chriſt calls <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel an Iſraelite indeed,</hi> Joh. 1.47. And the Saints are fitly repreſented by Precious Stones, becauſe they are indeed preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and excellent with a ſpiritual excellency, and that in the ſight of God, though deſpiſed of the world, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.4. <hi>Since thou waſt precious in my fight, thou haſt been honourable, and I have lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee; therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life</hi>— Pſal. 16.3. <hi>the Saints <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> that are on earth, the excellent in whom is all my delight.</hi> Lam. 4.7. <hi>Her Nazarites</hi> (and that religious Order was typical, as you have formerly heard) <hi>were purer then Snow, they were whiter then Milk, they were more ruddy in body then Rubies, their poliſhing was of Saphire.</hi> As theſe precious Stones in the Breſt-plate were divers and various, there were twelve of them, yet all of them precious and excellent, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: ſo the Saints are indoed with varieties of Gifts and Graces, yet all uſeful and excellent. And as theſe Stones were ſet in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and comely order in the Breſt-plate of <hi>Aaron:</hi> ſo there is an inſition of the Saints into Chriſt, and a comely order amongſt themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Look as the High Prieſt did bear the names of the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his Breſt-plate, for a memorial before the Lord: ſo doth Jeſus Chriſt bear the names and the concernments of his people upon his heart before the Lord, that is, in deareſt Love and Heart-affection. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.29. As he bore them upon the ſhoulders of his Power in the two Onyx-ſtones upon the ſhoulder-pieces of the Ephod, of which before: ſo now here he bears them upon his heart in deareſt Love and Favour. See <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.15, 16. Therefore the Church prays, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6. <hi>ſet me as a Seal upon thine Heart, as a Seal upon thine Arm.</hi> Theſe Stones were engraven like the ingravings of a Seal, or of a Signer.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="640" facs="tcp:96313:323"/>3. The faſtening of this Breſt-plate of Love to the ſhoulder-pieces of the Ephod, ſpeaks the inſeparable Conjunction of the Love and Power and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt in the great work of our Salvation. For the Ephod being an holy and glorious Garment ſignifies (as the reſt do) the glorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt the true High Prieſt, as hath been formerly ſhewed. The ſhoulders are ſtrong to ſupport: the Pectoral betokens Love: therefore that the Pectoral is faſtened to the ſhoulders ſpeaks, that Love and Power are united together in Jeſus Chriſt for our Salvation: and all this upon the Ephod, the Garments of his glorious Righteousneſs, wherein he appears for us, and bears our Names for a memorial before the Lord continually.</p>
               <p>How ſhould Faith triumph in this! Is not our High Prieſt in the Sanctuary? Is he not clothed with Garments of Salvation and Righteouſneſs? and doth he not bear the Names of his people upon his ſhoulders, and upon his Breſt before the Lord? Thy particular concernments (if thou art a Believer) are written upon his heart with the Pen of a Diamond, in ſuch laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letters of loving kindneſs as ſhall never be blotted out.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſeventh piece of theſe Sacerdotal Veſtments was the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim,</hi> of which the Text ſaith, <hi>Alſo he put in the Breſt-plate the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim,</hi> and <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.30. <hi>and thou ſhalt put in the Breſt-plate of Judgement the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and the Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim, and they ſhall be upon</hi> Aarons <hi>heart,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There is more of Difficulty and Controverſie upon this, then upon any other piece of all the Pontifical attire. I ſhall ſpeak but briefly to it in theſe four heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether they were any new Materials in the holy Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 2. What kind of Materials they were. 3. What was the end and uſe of them. 4. What Goſpel-myſteries were aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at therein.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim</hi> were viſible and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal materials in the holy Garments, yea or no. For ſome think they are only an expreſſion of the end and uſe of the Breſt-plate, and not another diſtinct piece of attire: But there are theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="641" facs="tcp:96313:323"/>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe the Text ſeems to ſpeak of them as Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; for it ſpeaks of them in the ſame courſe and tenor of ſpeech as it doth of other things. As here in the Text for inſtance: all the reſt of theſe three verſes are only enumerations of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Veſtments; <hi>He put on the Coat, girded him with the Girdle, put on him the Breſt-plate,</hi> all this is external material things; therefore why not alſo the next clauſe? <hi>and he put in the Breſt-plate the</hi> Urim <hi>and</hi> Thummim.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe we have an intimation of the loſs of them in the Captivity of <hi>Babylon. Ezra</hi> 2.63— <hi>Nehem.</hi> 7.65. If the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim and Thummim</hi> had been no other material, but the Breſt-plate it ſelf, with the Precious Stones therein (as ſome think) they might have conſulted with God, and received anſwers from God by it as formerly. For the Ordinances of God are bleſt of God, to ſuch as uſe them ſincerely for thoſe ends for which they are appointed. Therefore ſo would the Breſt-plate have been for Counſel and Anſwers to them, if that had been the Ordinance appointed for that end. For they did not want the Breſt-plate; for they might and ought to make that according to the Rule in <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. but they having not the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that way of Oracular Conſultation was ceaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. If there was any myſtery in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> they muſt needs be Materials: for we muſt not ſeparate and take away the outward ſign from the thing ſignified in the <hi>Types,</hi> no more then in the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> This is the ſin and error of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the Lords Supper, whereby they do deſtroy the true nature of the Sacrament. But thoſe that ſeem to ſcruple whether the Urim and Thummim were any new Materials added to the Breſt-plate, do yet inquire and ſeek after the myſtery and meaning of them: therefore there was an outward part in this, as in all other <hi>Types,</hi> a viſible and external ſign, as well as a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual myſtery ſignified and ſhadowed forth thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What kind of Materials they were?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ. The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim were</hi> not things prepared by the Workmen as the reſt of the holy Garments were; but <hi>ſome choiſe and ſecret Monuments given immediately unto</hi> Moſes <hi>by God himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="642" facs="tcp:96313:324"/>This appears by this conſideration, that there is no direction given for the making of them in <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.30. where all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Garments are treated of: but of theſe it is only ſaid, <hi>thou ſhalt put them in,</hi> ver. 30. and accordingly there is no mention of theſe in that other Chapter, <hi>Exod.</hi> 39. ver. 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where the Hiſtory of the making all the other Garments is recorded. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may concur with thoſe who ſay, this Ornament was <hi>non humano artificio factum, ſed Divinitus Moſi datum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to any further inquiry, we can no more determine the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them, then we can define what kind of Stones thoſe were on which the Law was written by the Finger of God; or what ſubſtance the Manna was, which was melted by the Sun, and hardened by the Fire; or of what ſubſtance the holy Fire was, that came down from Heaven and conſumed the Sacrifices. Therefore we can go no further in determining the nature of <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim;</hi> but that it <hi>was ſome glorious thing given by God to</hi> Moſes, <hi>and put into the Pectoral.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. What was the end and uſe of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To conſult with God by it, and to receive anſwers from him about the affairs and concernments of his people, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.21. <hi>Joſhua</hi> muſt ſtand before <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Prieſt, who muſt ask counſel for him, after the Judgment of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> before the Lord. Magiſtrates and Rulers ſhould depend on Chriſt for teaching, and ſeek direction at his Mouth: ſo <hi>David</hi> did 1 <hi>King.</hi> 23.9. and again 1 <hi>King.</hi> 30.6. And that this was no unuſual thing, but frequent and ordinary with him, appears 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.15. where <hi>Ahimelechs</hi> Apology for himſelf is, <hi>Did I now begin to ask of God for him?</hi> implying that he was formerly wont to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how was God wont to anſwer by it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It ſeems to have been ſometimes by audible voice, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.11, 12. <hi>Will</hi> Saul <hi>come down? and the Lord ſaid, he will: will the men of</hi> Keilah <hi>deliver me into his hand? and the Lord ſaid, they will— Numb.</hi> 7.89. God ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi> by an audible voice, and it ſeems that this was the way that God was ordinarily wont to uſe with <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.7, 8. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.10. Some think Gods ſpeaking by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> was by the
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:96313:324"/>
ſhining of the Stones, which did appear bright, if God would have them do the thing of which they inquired, but did appear dark, if the anſwer were negative. But as there is nothing of this in the Scripture; neither could this way anſwer all kinds of Queſtions that might be put: ſo it is more probable, that God anſwered by ſuch ways and manners as the Scripture makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of; either by ſpeaking from off the Mercy-ſeat with an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible voice to the Prieſt appearing with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: or elſe by immediate inſpirations and irradiations upon his Spirit, the Lord giving an inward revelation of his Will to the Mind of the High Prieſt thus inquiring of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. Now if you ask what did this Oracular diſpenſation by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim</hi> ſignifie and repreſent?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The words <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim ſignifie Lights and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi> The myſtery and meaning of them you may ſee in four particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some interpret them thus; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> or Lights, that is, clearneſs of Apprehenſion; and <hi>Thummim,</hi> Perfections, that is, exact and perfect Judgment. Thoſe two great parts of the Wiſdom of God, in the frame of Reaſon; where there is a conjunction of both theſe excellencies in the height of them, this is the higheſt degree of Reaſon. This is Angelical and Seraphick Underſtanding. Some men are ſlow and dull of Apprehenſion, a man cannot beat things into them, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.25. <hi>O ſlow and dull of heart to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand!</hi> Some that have Wit enough, and are apprehenſive enough; yet they cannot judge of what they ſee, of what their mind ſees, and ſo they call Darkneſs Light and Light Darkneſs; they call Error Truth and Truth Error. Thus ſome apply it to the two parts of Reaſon: and I would not exclude this, as being partly intended, becauſe the Scripture ſpeaks of Chriſt under theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; as quick in diſcerning, and accurate in judging of things, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.3. and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks it of his own Sermons, that he both <hi>ſought out;</hi> here is ready Invention, or quick Apprehenſion: and he <hi>took heed;</hi> here is accurate and careful Judgement, the other part of <hi>Solomons</hi> Logick: and he <hi>ſet in order many Proverbs;</hi> here is Method, which is the iſſue and reſult of both the former,
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:96313:325"/>
as the Cream of the Milk. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.9. And he took ſome pains in the Rhetorick too, as well as in the Logick; in the Oratory, as well as in the Reaſon of things, ver. 10. <hi>the Preacher ſought to find out words of delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be applied to the two faculties of the Soul, in regard of the virtues belonging to the faculties, as well as to the two parts of Reaſon thus. That <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> Lights, imports a ſound Faith; and <hi>Thummim,</hi> Perfections, a perfect heart and life. For, as clear Apprehenſion and exact Judgment are the two parts of true Reaſon: ſo Faith and Holineſs are the two parts of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. You know Light is the excellency of the Mind of a Chriſtian: Holineſs is the Perfection of his Will. Of the former <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17, 18. <hi>that the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Glory, may give unto you the ſpirit of Wiſdom and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, in the knowledge of him: the eyes of your underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enlightened,</hi> &amp;c. Of the other <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.3. <hi>I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart,</hi> &amp;c. ſo when <hi>Moſes</hi> prays for the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> and in them for all godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. <hi>Let thy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and thy Thummim be with thy holy ones;</hi> that is, give ſound Minds, and holy Hearts: ſound Minds in a quick diſcerning, and exact judging of things; and holy Hearts appearing in a holy and good life and converſation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All this pointed them to, and was moſt eminently fulfilled in Jeſus Chriſt the only true High Prieſt, in and by whom alone God ſpeaks his mind, and works his Image in us. <hi>In him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge,</hi> Col. 2.3. and he is holy and harmleſs and ſeparate from ſinners. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. <hi>For ſuch an High Prieſt became us who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners.</hi> He wears the true <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim</hi> always upon his heart: Illuminations and Perfections, Lights and Graces in the higheſt. And we have nothing of either, but what we have from him. Our Lights are from him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. our Graces are from him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>of his fulneſs have we all received Grace for Grace. For the Law was given by</hi> Moſes, ver. 17. theſe legal ſhadows of terror and darkneſs; <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Grace inſtead of legal terror and rigour. Truth,
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:96313:325"/>
that is, accompliſhments and performances inſtead of ſhadows and promiſes, came by Jeſus Chriſt. It follows, ver. 18. <hi>no man hath ſeen God at any time,</hi> that is, by any Light, or Grace, or Power of his own, <hi>but the only begotten Son which is in the boſom of the Father, he hath declared him.</hi> The true <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> is in the Pectoral of Jeſus Chriſt; all our Illuminations and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are in him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim</hi> were loſt in the Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and wanting in the ſecond Temple, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.63. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</hi> 7.65. They wanted this as they did ſome other veſſels and monuments; as the Golden Pot of Manna, <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod that bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; ſome think alſo the Ark, and the two Tables of Stone were wanting in the ſecond Temple: but as to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim</hi> thoſe Texts ſeem clear for it: nor had they the Cloud of Glory, as in the Tabernacle, and in the firſt Temple; or Fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The end of all this Diſpenſation was, to teach them to look and long the more earneſtly after Jeſus Chriſt, the true ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Glory of the Temple and Church of God, whoſe coming was now approaching and drawing on apace. Theſe abatements of that former outward Glory were preparations for more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Diſpenſations under the Goſpel, wherein thoſe outward Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were not to be expected: and in the mean time they had the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the written Word of God in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they were to cleave and ſtick cloſe unto. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.4. But when Chriſt came, he reſtored to his Church in a more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner the true <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim;</hi> Light and Grace was poured forth abundantly, even upon ſuch, who, by reaſon of the long intermiſſion of thoſe extraordinary Operations of the Holy Ghoſt, had not ſo much as heard whether there was an Holy Ghoſt or no. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.2, 6. The Jewiſh Writers have a ſaying and a tradition amongſt them, that after the latter Prophets, <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai, Zechariah,</hi> and <hi>Malachy,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt went up, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Iſrael.</hi> They mean, in thoſe extraordinary operations of it: and they reckon <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim</hi> as one of the degrees of the Holy Ghoſt, inferior to the Spirit of Propheſie; but ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to that <hi>Bath-qol</hi> (as they call it) the Daughter of a Voice, or
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:96313:326"/>
an Eccho from Heaven, which was heard ſometimes in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple, and which (they ſay) took place in the ſecond Temple when Propheſie and Urim ceaſed. We read of ſuch Voices from Heaven to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Joh</hi> 12.28, 29.— 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17, 18. and he adds in the next verſe, we <hi>have a more ſure Word of Propheſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Bath-qol,</hi> or Voice from Heaven, it was a Prologue and a Preface, and Type, as it were, of that true Voice of the Father, the eternal Word of God Jeſus Chriſt, who came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; by whom God hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken to us, who at ſundry times and in divers manners ſpake in former times unto the Fathers; but now only by his Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1, 2.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The eighth piece of the holy Pontifical attire, was the <hi>Mitre,</hi> of which the Text ſaith, <hi>And he put the Mitre upon his head.</hi> And it is ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.39. <hi>thou ſhalt make the Mitre of fine Linnen.</hi> This was one of the laſt Garments that was put on: therefore <hi>Zechariah</hi> deſires this in the clothing of <hi>Jehoſhuah,</hi> as the perfecting of the Mercy, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.5. <hi>and I ſaid, let them ſet a fair Mitre upon his head, ſo they ſet a fair Mitre upon his head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the ſhape and faſhion of this Garment, it was not unlike that which the other Prieſts wore, and is called <hi>a Bonnet.</hi> It was made of Linnen-cloth, wrapped about the head, in a round and high-crowned faſhion, after the manner of the Eaſt. Some compare it to the <hi>Turkiſh Turbants or Tullibants:</hi> ſome tranſlate it <hi>a Hat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the outward form and inward myſtery of it, there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle difficulty: For a Mitre, or a Hat upon the Head was an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of Authority and Superiority over others, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.26. <hi>Remove the Diadem.</hi> Job. 29.14. <hi>My Judgment was as a Diadem;</hi> in which places is radically the ſame word as here in <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. The Mitre therefore was an Ornament and Enſign of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious ſacred Eminency and Superiority in the High Prieſt over others. It pointeth us to the Princely Dignity and Kingly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Jeſus Chriſt: He is the great High Prieſt; and indeed both Prieſt and King of his Church; <hi>the true Archbiſhop, the chief Shepherd,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> calls him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. Believers are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:96313:326"/>
                  <hi>a royal Prieſthood,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. but Chriſt is ſo much more: He is not only a Prieſt, but a Prince and a Prevailer with the Lord on our behalf.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The ninth and laſt piece of the holy Prieſtly attire, is the Golden Plate, of which the Text ſaith, <hi>Alſo upon the Mitre, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon his forefront did he put the Golden Plate, the holy Crown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is called, <hi>Exod.</hi> 39.30. the <hi>Plate of the holy Crown;</hi> ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for that it was made (ſay ſome) ſomewhat like a Crown. Compare <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.6. The uſe and nature of it is deſcribed ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.36, 37, 38. The Inſcription <hi>Quodeſh la Jehovah,</hi> may be rendred more emphatically, <hi>the Holineſs of Jehovah.</hi> It ſpeaks three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Royal, yea the Divine Holineſs of Jeſus Chriſt, that abſolute Holineſs whereby he ſanctifies both himſelf and us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.19. wherein he doth that really, which <hi>Aaron</hi> did typically. He is indeed the Holines of <hi>Jehovah— Jehovah tſidkenu, the Lord our Righteouſneſs is his Name.</hi> Jer. 23.6. Hence he often appears with a Crown of Gold upon his Head, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His bearing our iniquities, and taking away our ſins, which are found even in our holy things, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.38. There is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the beſt we do. Many Believers are apt to be diſcouraged about it. My Prayers are ſo full of unbelief, and deadneſs, and wandrings, they deſerve abhorrence and not acceptance. Well, but the High Prieſt here bears the iniquities of all the holy things of the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. His cauſing us to be accepted of the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.38. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. <hi>He hath made us accepted in the beloved.</hi> Though we and our beſt works are vile; yet the Lord, looking upon the Forehead of our High Prieſt, ſees Holineſs engraven there: looking upon the Face of Chriſt, he there alſo beholds it for us, and becomes well pleaſed with us, and we in the Faith thereof perſuaded and aſſured of our acceptance with the Lord through the Faith of him. Thou that ſaieſt, there is nothing but ſin in me, ſin and vileneſs in all I do. I anſwer, it is true, the Lord can ſee nothing but ſin in thee; but he cannot look upon the High Prieſt, but there he ſees holineſs, yea the holineſs of <hi>Jehovah</hi> there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="648" facs="tcp:96313:327"/>Thus you have ſeen ſomething of the <hi>holy attire,</hi> which the Lord ordained and appointed for the Prieſts of old. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with two or three general words as by way of Uſe or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from the whole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. We may here ſee the evil of the ſuperſtitious Garments retained from Antichriſt for the Miniſters of the Goſpel. It is to transform Goſpel-Miniſters into legal Prieſts, yea into <hi>Popiſh Prieſts.</hi> The Prieſts under the Law had <hi>a long white Linnen Coat:</hi> hence Antichriſt hath <hi>a Surplice.</hi> The Prieſts of old were girded with <hi>a Girdle:</hi> hence is <hi>the Canonical Girdle,</hi> as they call it, which by many is now commonly called <hi>a Circingle,</hi> by way of contempt, and juſt and righteous ſcorn. The Prieſts under the Law had <hi>an holy Robe:</hi> hence is the <hi>Canonical Coat.</hi> They had <hi>an Ephod:</hi> hence is <hi>the Pall,</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> was wont to ſend to <hi>Archbiſhops,</hi> for their Conſecration, or Inſtallment.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the High Prieſt of old had <hi>a Mitre:</hi> hence is <hi>the Biſhops Mitre.</hi> And <hi>Ribera</hi> quotes a place out of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> where he ſaith, that the High Prieſt wore a tripple Crown, from whence he thinks St. <hi>Peter</hi> did the like, as the Pope now doth; that ſo the Verity might be anſwerable to to the Figure, that Chriſts High Prieſts might wear that which the High Prieſt, the Figure of Chriſt, did wear. <hi>Ribera de ſacr. Veſt. cap.</hi> 14. <hi>apud Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lett on Exod.</hi> 28. <hi>Controv.</hi> 4. But Dr. <hi>Willett</hi> anſwers him (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide many other juſt and rational anſwers, as that the Scripture doth not ſay, it was a triple Crown) <hi>I had thought</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that</hi> Aaron <hi>had been a Figure of Chriſt, not of the Pope;</hi> and temporal things do not prefigure temporal, one triple Crown another, but that outward Crown ſhadowed forth the ſpiritual Kingdom and Regal Dignity of Jeſus Chriſt. But againſt all theſe <hi>Popiſh Garments</hi> in general, obſerve two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That theſe things were typical and ſhadowy: therefore now that Chriſt the true High Prieſt is come in his Divine Glory, this external pomp and ſplendor of bodily Apparel is ceaſed, and vaniſhed away with all the reſt of the Ceremonies, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the Sun of Righteouſneſs. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> therefore in this matter, they <hi>do judaize.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="649" facs="tcp:96313:327"/>The Prieſt among the Papiſts, when he comes among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he comes forth juſt like a Prieſt of the Ceremonial Law, as if he were going to offer Sacrifice. Though withall, it is to be obſerved, that ſome of their ſuperſtitious Garments are not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the <hi>Jews,</hi> but either from the <hi>Pagans,</hi> or invented of their own heads. For they have a rich <hi>Wardrobe</hi> of ſuperſtitious Garments; as the <hi>Croſier Staff,</hi> the <hi>Albe,</hi> the <hi>Chimere,</hi> the <hi>grey Amice,</hi> the <hi>Stole,</hi> with ſuch like: ſome of which, for my part, I know not well what they are, nor whence they had them, nor is it worth the while to make much ſearch in Hiſtories and Fathers after them: but as in ſome they judaize, ſo in others I doubt they paganize.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve this, that the falſe Prieſts of old were much given to this kind of Superſtition: and not only they, but ſometimes good men were a little tainted with it, who abhorred the more open ſort of groſs Idolatry. <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.27. Gideon <hi>made an Ephod,</hi> a ſacred miniſtring Garment: but he intended no hurt, Good Man; for he was no Papiſt, he had broke down the Image of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;</hi> but yet this did offend the Lord, and became a ſnare to <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi> and to his Houſe. Suppoſe men be againſt the groſs Idolatry of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as our reforming Magiſtrates in <hi>England</hi> were, in the firſt Reformation; yet if they retain any of theſe Prieſtly Garments, it may offend God, and be a ſnare to them. But we have a groſſer inſtance in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.22. in <hi>Jehu</hi>'s time, who ſaid to him that was over the Veſtry, <hi>Bring forth the Veſtments for all the Worſhippers of</hi> Baal. It ſeems they had not only Worſhipping Veſtments, but ſuch a number of them, that it required a ſpecial Officer, to keep them, and look after them.</p>
               <p>There are but two Objections commonly alledged for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. It is decent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Decency in Clothing appears in common uſe and cuſtom, and is regulated thereby, and by the Light of Nature: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe Habits that men do not wear in common uſe are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted uncomely and ridiculous. And thence, though in old time they were wont to were white, and in thoſe hotter Climates they did much uſe Linnen; yet now in after-times people having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:96313:328"/>
themſelves to darker colours, as being graver, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring ſuch continual waſhing; as it would be ridiculous, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ridiculous, for a man to wear a white Shirt on the top of all his Clothes: ſo to do the like in the Worſhip of God, is a direct and manifeſt breach of that rule of Decency, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>ult.</hi> and ſo far from decent, that it is ridiculous and abſurd, God having not appointed any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>Moreover the meaning of that Scripture is not that men ſhould inſtitute and invent decent things; but only that they do admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the things of Chriſt, which he hath inſtituted in a decent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and further than this that Text gives no liberty; nay it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains men from medling further, then only to ſee that the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments and Ordinances of Chriſt be adminiſtred in a decent and orderly manner: But there is no decency in wearing a <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice;</hi> for then the want of it would be undecent, which common ſenſe tells us it is not. Nor did Chriſt or the Apoſtles worſhip God undecently, and yet they never prayed or preached in a <hi>Surplice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. Better do it, then not preach: I had rather preach in a Fools Coat (ſaid one) then not preach the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We muſt not do evil, that good may come thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. and therefore we may not preach in a <hi>Fools Coat:</hi> for it is not decent. The plain truth is, that this pretenſe which ſo many have abuſed themſelves withall, that they had rather preach in a <hi>Fools Coat,</hi> forſooth, then not preach the Goſpel, it is a weak and ſinful ſpeech. The firſt that ſpake it, as I have heard, was a <hi>French Proteſtant,</hi> who being <hi>made a Prebend by King James,</hi> was content to accept of it, and made this excuſe, he not underſtanding, or not rightly conſidering the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies that were then on foot about it: as if a man ſhould ſay, he had rather lye, or ſteal, or whore, or be drunk, or kiſs the Pix, or bow to an Idol, or go to Maſs, then not preach the Goſpel. For I beſeech you conſider, either it is a ſin, or it is not a ſin. If it be not a ſin to preach in a <hi>Fools Coat,</hi> or in a <hi>Surplice,</hi> prove this, and then uſe it, and wear it in the name of God: But if it be a ſin, it is not a ſuppoſed good intent to ſave a Soul, that will juſtifie an evil action, though it be not ſo foul an evil as ſome others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="651" facs="tcp:96313:328"/>If a Miniſter would fain do good to Souls, and therefore is very loth to be ſilenced, let him obſerve this rule; let him take heed of conforming, leſt God ſilence him; leſt God ſtop his mouth, or blaſt his endeavours, that he ſhall never ſpeak with any great evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit, nor with any great ſucceſs for the good of Souls: For I ſee but few <hi>Surplices</hi> or <hi>Circingle men</hi> that do much good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. To confute the Popiſh Allegorizers, who tell us the literal ſenſe of theſe Garments is ſuch as this; namely, That the diſpoſition and frame of the World is expreſſed in them, and that the High Prieſt did thereby profeſs himſelf the Miniſter or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Creator of Heaven and Earth.

               <p>This they call the literal account of theſe holy Prieſtly Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Well, then they come to the myſtical ſenſe, and there they tell us; That the Linnen Breeches ſignifie Chaſtity, the Linnen Coat, purity of Life; the Girdle, moderation of Diſcretion; the Mitre, a right Intention; which they ſay are virtues neceſſary for all Miniſters: over and above which, <hi>Biſhops,</hi> they ſay, muſt have four others, which they fancy to be ſignified by the other Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the High Prieſt. But theſe are too vain to inſiſt on a large Confutation of them.</p>
               <p>As theſe Interpretations and Applications of theirs have no
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:96313:329"/>
footing in Scripture, nor the leaſt countenance given them from thence: ſo there is a profound ſilence concerning Chriſt therein, paſſing him over wholly, when as indeed He, and his Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Endowments are the great thing taught and ſhadowed forth by them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. See and behold in theſe holy Pontifical Veſtments the ſpiritual Glory of Jeſus Chriſt the true High Prieſt. For all this did repreſent <hi>pluſquam Angelicam Splendorem, Calvin,</hi> that more then Angelical Splendor of Jeſus Chriſt, who is clothed indeed with Glory and Beauty.</p>
               <p>Let me but briefly run over, and recapitulate the heads of things according to the Explications given.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here is the white and pure Linnen of his perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, imputed to us in Juſtification: For that is one great thing intended by it, as well as the Garments of Holineſs and Grace inherent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is girded with Strength, and with Truth and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for our Salvation, and is always ready to do us good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He hath a glorious Robe, the Golden Bells whereof have ſounded in the holy place; and their ſound is gone forth into all the earth; and the Fruits thereof are ſweet and fragrant as a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Pomegranates.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He wears a glorious Ephod, in the ſhoulders whereof he doth ſupport his Church; and lifts up them and their concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of the duſt of death, and ſin, and miſery; and bears them up before the Lord, as upon the ſhoulders of an infinite and almighty Power.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He hath a Breſt-plate of Love upon his Heart continually; our Names and our Concernments are written there, even upon the Heart of Jeſus Chriſt, like the Names of the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> upon <hi>Aarons</hi> Breſt-plate.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Here is the true Urim and Thummim; all Divine Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Perfections in the Heart of Jeſus Chriſt, and Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Light and Holineſs from him to us.</p>
               <p n="7">7. He hath a Mitre upon his Head; He is a Royal Prieſt, both King and Prieſt; He reconciles us effectually, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:96313:329"/>
with Power, as a Prince prevailing with the Lord.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And laſtly, he wears a Golden Crown of Holineſs upon his Forehead before the Lord.</p>
               <p>And having ſuch an High Prieſt; Is not all this enough to ſtrengthen Faith, and to encourage you not only to believe, but to rejoyce in believing, even to rejoyce and triumph in Jeſus Chriſt?</p>

               <p>THe Contents printed in your Bibles give you the true Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis of this Chapter, for there be three things in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Conſecration of the Prieſts, to ver. 38. 2. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Burnt-offering, ver. 38, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. The Lords Promiſe of his gracious Preſence with the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ver. 45. It is only the firſt of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Conſecration of the Aaronical Prieſts</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Office, that we are now to ſpeak unto.</p>
               <p>There be four things wherein thoſe Prieſts of old were <hi>Types.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In their Prieſtly Qualifications and other Rites and Rules obſerved by them. 2. In their Apparel. 3. In their Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Office. 4. In their Prieſtly Miniſtrations. The two former of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> their Prieſtly and ritual Qualifications, as alſo their holy Garments have been ſpoken to. That which follows next, is their Conſecration to their Office, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared at large in two places, almoſt two whole Chapters of holy Scripture. The Direction of it in this 29th of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and the Execution of it in the 8th Chapter of <hi>Leviticus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Conſecration was the ſolemn Inveſtiture of them in their Office, which was done by ſundry ſacred and myſtical Rites and Ceremonies ordained and appointed of God for that end. They
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:96313:330"/>
were chiefly theſe four, all mentioned in both theſe places, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. 1. Waſhing them. 2. Apparrelling them with the holy Garments. 3. Anointing them with the holy Oyl. 4. Sacrificing, and ſo ſanctifying them by Blood. All which I ſhall put together in one general Propoſition, or point of Doctrine, which will indeed contain the ſum of this whole Chapter, as far as to ver. 38.</p>
               <p>Doctr. <hi>That the Conſecration of the Prieſts of old was done by waſhing them, and by apparrelling them with the holy Garments, and by anointing them with the holy Oyl, and by ſacrificing, and ſo ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them by the Blood thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When all this was done, they might officiate in the Prieſts Office all their days. And all theſe things did point unto ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Chriſt repreſented by theſe Performances, and may be applied in a ſecondary and inferior way to Miniſters and Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but firſt and chiefly unto Chriſt himſelf, For as the Prieſts by this Conſecration became Prieſts all their days, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. v. 9. <hi>and the Prieſts Office ſhall be theirs by a perpetual Statute; for thou ſhalt conſecrate</hi> Aaron <hi>and his Sons:</hi> ſo the Son of God is <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated a Prieſt for evermore. Heb.</hi> 7.28. <hi>Confer. v.</hi> 27. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of Jeſus Chriſt is the Commiſſion of the whole work of our Salvation into his hand by God the Father.</p>
               <p>But in the Rites of the Conſecration of the Prieſts of old there was (as of neceſſity there muſt be) a diſparity between the Type and Antitype; there was a great diſproportion between Chriſt and them, ſundry of thoſe Rites not agreeing to them both, in the ſame direct manner; ſundry Purifications which they uſed, were rather to make them become fit <hi>Types</hi> of Chriſt, then that they ſignified ſuch parallel actions to be done by Chriſt. The Prieſts by means thereof repreſented that Purity which is in Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe means. They were purified, but Chriſt was pure: ſo that in Purity there is an agreement between Chriſt and them; but in the manner and means thereof, there is a difference. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26, 27. And therefore when any ſuch actions are aſcribed unto Chriſt, as when he ſaith, <hi>I ſanctifie my ſelf, Joh.</hi> 17.19. it is to be underſtood rather in regard of the effect, then of the action,
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:96313:330"/>
rather of the thing it ſelf, then of the means: but ſuch active ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are uſed partly in relation to the <hi>Type,</hi> the Prieſts of old, and partly in relation to the Church of Chriſt, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, whereof he is the Head: whatever is done to them, being firſt done to him their Head, ſo far as the incommunicable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of either will permit. He is therefore pleaſed ſo to ſpeak of himſelf, as being conſecrated, and ſanctified, and the like. Not as though there had been any defect of Holineſs in him, but as repreſenting them in himſelf. Moreover, we muſt remember that theſe things are not to be looked upon by us as terminated in the perſon of Chriſt himſelf; but as relating further to his Church and Members, for whom he is an High Prieſt and Mediator with the Lord. <hi>Meminerimus, quae de Conſecratione dicuntur, non ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtere in ejus perſonâ, ſed referri ad totius Eccleſiae utilitatem. Calv. in Exod.</hi> 29.6.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the particular Ceremonies of their Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they were thoſe four, as beforementioned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt part of their Conſecration was <hi>their waſhing with water, Exod.</hi> 29.4. <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.6. This intimated and hinted two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The perfect Purity and Holineſs of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. <hi>who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, and ſuch an High Prieſt as behoved us to have.</hi> For we needed an holyer Prieſt then thoſe of the Aaronical Order. They were typically holy, and ſome of them really, but Chriſt infinitely.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This pointed alſo at the Baptiſm of Chriſt at his firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon his publick Miniſtry, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. Thus this great High Prieſt was conſecrated and initiated by waſhing with water. The firſt thing he doth to his people, is, to waſh them. He findeth them in a wretched and lothſom condition, polluted in their own Blood, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.9. <hi>then waſhed I thee with water, yea I thoroughly waſhed away thy Blood from thee, and I anointed thee with Oyl:</hi> and ſo they did to the Prieſts of old, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>He hath loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins with his own Blood, and hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto God and his Father.</hi> Therefore ſinners are exhorted unto this, as the firſt thing they have to do, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.16. <hi>waſh ye, and make ye clean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="656" facs="tcp:96313:331"/>2. The ſecond Ceremony of Conſecration was, <hi>the apparelling of them with the holy Garments, Exod.</hi> 29.5. <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.7. Theſe Garments are deſcribed at large in the precedent Chapter, <hi>viz. Exod.</hi> 28. they were therefore ſpoken to under a former Head. You have heard how they did betoken all thoſe ſpiritual Graces and Excellencies which our great High Prieſt is furniſhed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with. And the next work of his Grace upon us, after the waſhing away of ſin, is to clothe the Souls of his people with the Garment of Holineſs, and ſo to make them every way beautiful. See that eminent Scripture, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.9. and what follows, ver. 10. <hi>I clothed thee alſo with broydered work, and ſhod thee with Badgers skin, and girded thee about with fine Linnen, and I covered thee with Silk.</hi> See alſo the next following verſes, <hi>viz.</hi> 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Ceremony of conſecrating, was <hi>the anointing them with holy Oil,</hi> Exod. 29.7. <hi>Lev.</hi> 8.12. The Compoſition of which ſacred Ointment is inſtituted and directed in <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.23. As to the myſtery and meaning of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This holy Oil ſignified the Spirit of God, and anointing therewith, the Communication of the Spirit in the ſaving Graces, and in the Divine Joys and Conſolations of it: ſo <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, the Lord hath anointed me</hi>— Act. 10.38. <hi>He anointed Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The anointing of the Prieſts ſignified the anointing of Jeſus Chriſt with the Spirit beyond meaſure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.34.</p>
               <p>This is called the Reſting of the Spirit upon him, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.2. as upon <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.15. and upon <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad, Numb.</hi> 11.26. ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. the Spirit of God and of Glory reſts on the Members of Chriſt, eſpecially when in ſufferings, it being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived unto them from him. Hence he is called the Meſſias <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the anointed one, becauſe he chiefly is anointed with the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As this holy Oil ſtayed not upon <hi>Aarons</hi> head, but deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ran down upon his Beard, and to the skirts of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as is obſerved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.2. ſo the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of Chriſt diſtills, and is diffuſed from Chriſt the Head unto all the Members of his Body, ſo as the meaneſt Saints have this anointing
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:96313:331"/>
in their meaſure, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20, 27. and do <hi>receive of his fulneſs, even Grace for Grace,</hi> Joh. 1.16. hence they bear his name, and are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſtians, as being partakers of his anointing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Tabernacle, and the Altar, and all the holy Veſſels were anointed with the ſame ſacred Oil, when he anointed <hi>Aaron,</hi> at the ſame time alſo he anointed them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 8.10, 11, 12. The myſtery of this is evident. It teacheth us, that all Ordinances and Performances profit not, unleſs they be anointed, unleſs the Spirit be in them, with the power and preſence of his Grace. This makes them moſt holy and effectual for good, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.29. and if he breath in them, whatſoever toucheth them is holy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This holy Oyl might not be put to any common uſe; <hi>upon mans fleſh it ſhall not be poured,</hi> Exod. 30.31, 32. which plainly intimates thus much; That carnal and unregenerate men have not the Spirit, that there be ſome who have not the Spirit, <hi>viz. all carnal men, Jude</hi> 19. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 6, 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nor might any be made like unto it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.33. Men are not to imitate and counterfeit the Ordinances of God, or the Graces of his Spirit. It is the brand ſet upon <hi>Jeroboam, that he deviſed a day of his own heart, like unto the Feaſt which is in</hi> Judah. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.32.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth and laſt part of their Conſecration was, by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing, and ſanctifying them by the Blood thereof, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.10, <hi>&amp;c. Lev.</hi> 8.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſignifying how that Chriſt ſhould put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26, and ver 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But then here a queſtion preſently ariſeth; How comes this in here in Conſecration? For the death and ſufferings of Chriſt ſeem to belong rather to the Execution of his Prieſtly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, then to his Initiation and Conſecration thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> To this there may be three Anſwers given.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is in this a diſparity between the Type and the Antitype, as the Apoſtle intimates, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27, 28. this is ſome part of an Anſwer, but this is not all; for it would be harſh in this ſo main a part of their Conſecration, not at all to reſemble Chriſt. Therefore for a further Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Chriſt was conſecrated to the full execution of his
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:96313:332"/>
Prieſtly Office by his death and ſufferings. He could not offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate as Mediator and perform the whole work of his Prieſtly Office; he could not ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, till he had ſuffered death. It is true Chriſt was a Prieſt before; but he was but a Prieſt in a ſtate of abaſement and humiliation: but he was not capacitated to execute the triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of his Prieſtly Office, till he had firſt humbled himſelf unto death: therefore he is ſaid to be <hi>conſecrated through ſufferings, Heb.</hi> 2.10. This word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is uſed by the Greek Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for Conſecration in <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. and elſewhere, and ſo rendred by our Tranſlators, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8, 9. <hi>being conſecrated,</hi> which we render being made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, though he were a Son; yet <hi>having learned obedience by the things he ſuffered, and ſo being conſecrated, he became the Author of eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</hi> He could not become ſuch an Author till conſecrated by his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, or made perfect. Chriſt muſt firſt dye, and ſo put away ſin, before he can appear in the preſence of God in Heaven for us, which is a great part of his Prieſtly Office. <hi>Chriſtum oportuit Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce inaugurari in ſuum primatum, Calvin. in Heb.</hi> 2.10. <hi>vid. Calv. in Exod.</hi> 29.16. He was a Prieſt in the form of a Servant before; but he was not a Prieſt in glory, till conſecrated thereunto by his own Blood.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some apply it to the Goſpel-Miniſtry thus; That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Miniſtry was conſecrated by the Blood of Chriſt. For though it is true, the Miniſtry is the immediate fruit of Chriſts Aſcenſion into Glory; as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. yet his Exaltation being ſounded in his Death: here therefore is the foundation of the Church and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. How great is their ſin, who deſpiſe their Office, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject their Meſſage, and ſo deſpiſe the Glory, yea alſo deſpiſe the Death and Blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now concerning this part of their Conſecration, <hi>viz.</hi> by Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, there be divers things obſervable. There were divers Rites and Ceremonies particularly required in theſe Sacrifices of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, which were common to all the Sacrifices; as the killing them, pouring out the Blood, burning them upon the Altar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="659" facs="tcp:96313:332"/>
which I ſhall not handle in this place, but rather refer them to the head of Jewiſh Sacrifices, as their more proper place to which they do belong; and where they have been ſpoken to. See be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>pag.</hi> 248, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore at this time I ſhall only mention ſuch ſpecial Rites and Ceremonies as are peculiar to this buſineſs of Conſecration. And of this kind there are four Rules here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were to offer all ſorts of Sacrifices, <hi>a Sin-offering,</hi> ver. 14. <hi>a Burnt-offering,</hi> v. 18. and <hi>a Peace-offering,</hi> v. 28. to teach not only the ſpecial Holineſs that ought to be found in them; but the deepneſs of the ſtain and guilt of Sin: that there muſt be Expiations of all ſorts to cleanſe them throughly from it: <hi>tantae molis erat:</hi> ſo great a work it was to cleanſe the Soul from ſin. And to ſhew the compleat and perfect cleanſing and expiation that is in the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt: we are perfectly clean through him: He is both Sin-offering, and Burnt-offering, and Peace-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all in all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The method and order of theſe Sacrifices is remarkable: for they were firſt to offer the Sin-offering, then the whole Burnt-offering, and then the Peace-offering. This is to be interpreted by the conſideration of thoſe peculiar reſpects which each kind of Offering had: though they did all aim at the ſame general ſcope, the purging away of ſin; yet if we conſider them diſtinctly. The Sin-offering ſpeaks Pardon of Guilt; the Holocauſt, or the whole Burnt-offering, the dedication or giving up our ſelves to God, to his uſe or Service by the fire of his Spirit; the Peace-offering, our Thankfulneſs in the ſenſe and aſſurance of Peace between God and us. The reſt could not have been accepted if the Sin-offering had not gone before, and made way for them. Hence the Inſtruction is, that till ſin be done away, all Sacrifices and Services are abominable. Make that thy firſt work, thy great and prime requeſt to God, to get Pardon of ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third remarkable Rite about theſe Sacrifices of Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this, that the Blood was to be put upon the tip of the right ear, and upon the thumb of the right hand, and the great toe of the right foot of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, ver. 20. To teach and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:96313:333"/>
that the work of Goſpel-Sanctification doth extend to the whole man, to all the parts and members of the Body, and to all the powers and faculties of the Soul: ſo the Apoſtle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in that Prayer of his for the Theſſalonians, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>the very God of Peace, Sanctifie you wholly, aad I pray that your whole Spirit, and Soul, and Body be preſerved blameleſs unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> There ſhould be in ſpiritual Prieſts a ſanctified ear to abhor corrupt communication, and to receive readily holy and ſpiritual Inſtructions; the hand alſo ſhould be ſanctified for acting, and the foot for walking in the ways of God.</p>
               <p>It may further intimate, that the external application of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental ſign to ſome principal part or parts of the Body, is ſignificative enough of univerſal cleanſing. <hi>Vid. Engl. Annot. in loc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Moſes</hi> was to fill the hand of the Prieſts with ſome parts of the Sacrifices, ver. 23, 24, 25. This interprets and lets you ſee the reaſon of that expreſſion, why Conſecration is called fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the hand, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.37. ſo <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.41. and here cap. 29. ver. 9. It is becauſe ſome parts of the Sacrifices were put into his hands at his Conſecration, as a pledge or ſymbol of putting ſuch a buſineſs, and intruſting ſuch a work in his hands. No man can or ought to undertake this or any other Truſt, or Office, till the Lord fill his hand with it, and commit the work and buſineſs to his truſt. <hi>A man can take unto himſelf nothing, except it be given him from Heaven,</hi> Joh. 3.27. they are the words of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and he ſaith of Chriſt, <hi>that the Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand,</hi> ver. 35. of that 3d. of <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Uſe of all theſe Rites of Conſecration lies in ſuch things as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were an external ſign and repreſentation of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Office; therefore there were ſo many ſolemn and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ceremonies in ſetting them apart thereunto: and yet theſe Prieſts were but ſhadows of Jeſus Chriſt, our great and true High Prieſt, whoſe Office is of incomparably more ſurpaſſing excellency and Dignity. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="661" facs="tcp:96313:333"/>2. All theſe Rites of Conſecration had this uſe to the Prieſts themſelves, to be Monitors or Remembrances to the Prieſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; that they might remember how pure and holy to the Lord they ought to be. And the like Inſtruction they hold out to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, who all are made ſpiritual Prieſts unto God, that they ought to be holy to the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the people they beſpeak reverence and regard to the Prieſts, and that for their works ſake, they having ſuch Honour and Dignity put upon them in ſuch a ſolemn Conſecration to their Office. Thus the Apoſtle in the New Teſtament chargeth the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>know them that laboured among them, that were over them in the Lord, and admoniſhed them, and to eſteem them very highly in love for their works ſake.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.12, 13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We may learn alſo this from theſe ſacred Rites of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the Prieſts, that under the New Teſtament there ſhould be no Goſpel-Miniſters, but ſuch as are called and conſecrated by God to that work; ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. 'Tis ſet as a Brand upon that wicked <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> that <hi>he made of the baſeſt of the people Prieſts, even whoſever would, he conſecrated him: but this thing became ſin to the Houſe of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>even to cut it off, and to deſtroy it from off the face of the earth;</hi> as the Holy Ghoſt expreſly tells us, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.33, 34.</p>

               <p>THere were three ſorts of Officers in the old Legal Miniſtry. 1. The Prieſts. 2. The Levites. 3. The Nethinims. Of the Prieſts you have heard four things propounded. 1.

               <p>The Chapter conſiſts of two parts. 1. The Work of the Prieſts and Levites. 2. Their Maintenance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their Work and Office to ver. 8. The ſeveral Work of the Prieſts and of the Levites is here exactly diſtinguiſhed, their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Offices bounded and diſterminated by the Soveraign Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Authority of God, ſetting each their limits, which they might not on higheſt penalties tranſgreſs and violate. The charge of the Sanctuary and the Altar, with the things appertaining thereunto, was committed to the Prieſts: the charge of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle to the Levites, ver. 7.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Prieſts, their work was the charge of the Sanctuary and the Altar, and the holy Veſſels and Services thereof. Theſe they muſt look to, and of theſe God would require and expect an account at their hands. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>thou and thy Sons, and thy Fathers Houſe with thee ſhall bear the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Sanctuary, and of your Prieſthood,</hi> ver. 1. that is, the
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:96313:334"/>
guilt and puniſhment of whatever is done amiſs in theſe matters. <hi>The Stranger that cometh nigh ſhall be put to death,</hi> ver. 7. the <hi>Stranger</hi> here is not meant of other People and Nations only, as in other places; but any other Family beſide the Family of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> the reſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yea the Levites themſelves were Strangers in this ſenſe.</p>
               <p>There are many particulars compriſed under this general head, of the Charge of the Altar and Sanctuary; in each of which I ſhall but briefly ſhew, how they had an eye to Jeſus Chriſt the Prieſt and Miniſter of the true Sanctuary.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt then, this includes the holy Veſſels, and all the hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things thereof, ver. 7. ſo <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.5-15. and ver. 16. In like manner hath God committed the whole Church of God, and all the myſteries of our Salvation to the truſt, and care, and charge of Jeſus Chriſt; for the Tabernacle is the Church. All the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of his people, all their Graces, and Duties, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts meet in him, and are under his ſpecial care and truſt: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſaid to be <hi>given to him by the Father.</hi> Joh. 3.35.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The offering Sacrifice, and ordering that whole matter is here alſo plainly included, as being part of the Charge of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; the Prieſt was to kill and dreſs the Sacrifices, and ſprinkle the Blood thereof, and to manage and diſpoſe of that whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>and he,</hi> that is the Prieſt, <hi>ſhall kill the Bullock before the Lord; and the Prieſts, the Sons of</hi> Aaron, <hi>ſhall ſprinkle the Blood,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 5.1. <hi>Every High Prieſt taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both Gifts and Sacrifices for Sins:</hi> and the ſame Apoſtle applies it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.3. <hi>For every High Prieſt is ordained to offer Gifts and Sacrifices. wherefore it is of neceſſity, that this man,</hi> that is, Chriſt, <hi>have ſomewhat alſo to offer,</hi> that is, himſelf, his own bleſſed Body and Humane nature. This is the Sacrifice he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. And ſo he himſelf was both the Sacrifice and the Prieſt; the Prieſt in regard of both his Natures, and the Sacrifice in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his human nature; ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10, 11, 12. No other can offer any expiatory Sacrifice to make atonement with the Lord, but only he— <hi>He trod the Wine-preſs alone</hi> in this reſpect, <hi>and
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:96313:335"/>
of the people there was none with him,</hi> as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Prieſts were to light the ſeven ſacred Lamps of the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Candleſtick, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27.20, 21. <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.2, 3. This ſhadows forth Chriſt the true Light, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. ſhining forth and enlightening his Church by his Spirit in the Miniſtry of the Word: For the Golden Candleſticks are the Churches; the ſeven Stars, or Lights in the tops of the Candleſticks, are the Angels or Miniſters of the Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. yet the Miniſtry conſidered barely in it ſelf doth not enlighten, but as illuminated by the Spirit. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Prieſt was to burn ſweet Incenſe upon the Golden Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar when he dreſſed the Lamps, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.7, 8. this is Prayer and Interceſſion, and this is Chriſts work: he prays, and he perfumes the Prayers of his people with the ſweet Incenſe of his own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Mediation: and as they are daily praying; ſo Chriſt is daily interceding for them. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3, 4.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Prieſt was to ſet the Shew-bread upon the Golden Table before the Lord every Sabbath, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.8. <hi>Every Sabbath ſhall he ſet it in order before the Lord continually:</hi> ſo doth Jeſus Chriſt preſent, and ſet the whole number of his Elect before the Lord continually, as the Shew-bread upon the Table, where his favourable Eye and Face is always upon them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Prieſt was to bleſs the people in the name of the Lord: and well he might; for bleſſed indeed are ſuch a people, who have ſuch an Altar and Sanctuary, and ſuch a Sacrifice offered for them; amongſt whom the Lamp of God ſhines, whoſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers aſcend and come up before him, as Incenſe upon the Golden Altar out of the hand of the true High Prieſt, the Angel of the Covenant, and who ſtand before the Face of God, and under the Eye and Care of God continually, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.23. and ſo on to the end; and accordingly they did ſo, when they had performed their other Miniſtrations, <hi>Lev.</hi> 9.22, 23. and God ratified it. <hi>For the Glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people:</hi> ſo 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.27. <hi>Then the Prieſts the Levites aroſe and bleſſed the people: and their voice was heard, and their Prayer came up to his dwelling place, even unto Heaven:</hi> ſo doth Jeſus Chriſt bleſs his people,
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:96313:335"/>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 24.50. and that moſt really and effectually, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. Theſe were the Prieſtly Miniſtrations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objct.</hi> But now it may be demanded, wherein then differed the High Prieſt from the other ordinary Prieſts, theſe Miniſtrations belonging to them, as well as him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There were three things peculiar to the High Prieſt, wherein he was advanced by God above his Brethren.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He had a ſuperiority of ſpiritual Power and Juriſdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Miniſters of the Sanctuary, both the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.19. alſo ver. 27. ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.12. and ſo <hi>Aaron</hi> was the Archbiſhop, or Primate as it were, to overſee and order all: ſo is Jeſus Chriſt in the Church of God; He is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. <hi>And when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, ye ſhall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</hi> He only is the chief Shepherd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The High Prieſt was clothed with peculiar Garments of Glory and Beauty, <hi>Exod</hi> 28. The inferior Prieſts, the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> had but four Prieſtly Garments; Linnen Drawers, and Coats, and Girdles, and Bonnets, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.40. but <hi>Aaron</hi> the High Prieſt had a Breſt-plate, and an Ephod, a Robe, a broydered Coat, a Mitre, and a Girdle, with the Urim and Thummim, and precious Stones in his Breſt-plate, and on the ſhoulders of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phod, and a Crown or Plate of Gold upon his Mitre, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. ver. 4. and ſo is Jeſus Chriſt <hi>fairer then the Sons of men,</hi> more beautiful then any other, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Prerogative of the High Prieſt was in his glorious Miniſtration upon the great day of atonement, when he went into the holieſt of all, to make atonement there before the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. which none but he might do. Thus Jeſus Chriſt is entred not into the holy places made with hands, which are the Figures of the true; but into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Neither by the Blood of Goats and Calves; but by his own Blood he entred in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal Redemption for us, ibid.</hi> ver. 12.</p>
               <p>Here note, as a Corollary, the wickedneſs of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who calls himſelf the High Prieſt amongſt Chriſtians, as
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:96313:336"/>
                  <hi>Aaron</hi> was amongſt the Jews. His judaizing antichriſtian wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And all other ſuch Archbiſhops and Primates and Prelates fall under the ſame condemnation; who differ not <hi>ſpecie,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>grad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> not in kind, but only in degree, from the Uſurpations of that Man of Sin.</p>
               <p>I know no other High Prieſt, no other Archbiſhop, or chief Shepherd of our Souls under the Goſpel, but only Jeſus Chriſt. Some thus underſtand that of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 23.5. <hi>I wiſt not that he was the High Prieſt,</hi> I acknowledg not that there is an High Prieſt. <hi>Vide Beza in</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4.</p>
               <p>Againſt this Primacy which the Pope uſurps, conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The High Prieſt in this preeminence above his Brethren was an expreſs <hi>Type of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> of whom it is ſaid, that <hi>he was the firſt-born among many Brethren,</hi> Rom. 8.29.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Eccleſiaſtical preeminence amongſt Miniſters is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden under the Goſpel. How often doth Chriſt reprove his Diſciples for it; <hi>for ſtriving who ſhould be chiefeſt, Matth.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3, 4. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.8, 10, 11. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.25. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22.24, 25, 26. And it is the brand ſet upon <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> ver. 9. that he did <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that he affected the Primacy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thô the Prieſts Power was eccleſiaſtical; yet the Pope exerciſes a temporal power; and this, not as a Commiſſioner from &amp; under the Civil Magiſtrate, but diſtinct from the Civil Magiſtrate, and without dependance on him, yea indeed ſuperior to him: and ſo do the inferior Prelates too, not only a Civil power derived from the <hi>King,</hi> as other Barons of the Realm, or Juſtices of the Peace, or the like civil Dignities; but they make the Clergy a Fountain of Power to themſelves, even of temporal Power, (wherein they intrench upon the Prerogative and juſt Rights of the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate) as well as of Eccleſiaſtical Power, having never received any ſuch Primacy of Office from Jeſus Chriſt, but uſurping it to themſelves: and ſo they do intrench both upon <hi>God and the King,</hi> ſhewing themſelves therein to be the true and natural Children of their Father the <hi>Pope,</hi> the great <hi>Antichriſt of Rome.</hi> But you ſee how remote this is from the Spirit of the Goſpel, and that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Judaizing, for Miniſters to aſſume a diſparity &amp; ſuperiority
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:96313:336"/>
of Power, and Eccleſiaſtical or Spiritual Juriſdiction over other Miniſters. So much of the Prieſts, and of their Prieſtly Work and Miniſtrations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort of Temple Officers were the <hi>Levites,</hi> of whom four things are worthy to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Who they were; they were the whole Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only <hi>Aarons</hi> Poſterity, who were preferred to an higher Office of Prieſthood; yet they were Levites, but all Levites were not Prieſts. The Prieſts were Levites in regard of their Birth and Extraction out of that Tibe; but they were not Levites in regard of their Office: nor were the Levites Prieſts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The occaſion of their Separation to this Office. And there are two or three occaſions of it noted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lords paſſing by the firſt-born of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he ſlew the firſt-born of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 13.2. on which occaſion the Lord challenged the firſt-born to himſelf, and required they ſhould be ſanctified to him. But afterwards the Lord was pleaſed to take the Levites from amongſt the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> inſtead of all the firſt-born. See <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.11, 12, 13. <hi>Therefore the Levites ſhall be mine,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>becauſe all the firſt-born are mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Faithfulneſs of the Levites in a time of great Apoſtacy and temptation; the Story whereof you have in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.28, 29. and it is afterwards remembred by <hi>Moſes</hi> before the Lord in his bleſſing of them. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The later Rebellion of <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> with the lamentations, and ſelf-condemning complaints of the people upon that occaſion. Compare cap. 17. of <hi>Numbers,</hi> the two laſt verſes, with the firſt verſes of this 18th chapter. That Complaint of the people; <hi>Behold we dye, we periſh, we all periſh,</hi> is an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation of the danger: for they were under the ſenſe of the dread and Majeſty of the dreadful preſence of God in his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, and thereupon they thus ſpake.</p>
               <p>From all which we may obſerve, that ſuch as God cals to any Work and Office, he doth uſually give many viſible intimations of it: he doth deſign and prepare them to it by many fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Providences.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="668" facs="tcp:96313:337" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. The Rites and manner of their Separation and Conſecration to their Office. This is recorded and declared at large in <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. where you will find it was, by ſprinkling them with Water, by ſhaving their Hair, by waſhing their Clothes, and by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifices for them. And laſtly by the Children of <hi>Iſraels</hi> laying their hands upon them. But I ſhall not ſpeak to theſe things, though it would be worth the while; Becauſe there hath been occaſion to ſpeak to ſundry of theſe Rites in other places formerly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Their Work and Office which they were thus ſeparated and ſet apart unto, which was in general to be adjoyned, as ſubordinate Miniſters to the Prieſts, in the outer Services and Miniſtrations of the Temple: ſo here, ver. 2. <hi>that they may be joyned unto thee:</hi> alluding to the name of <hi>Levi,</hi> which bears that ſignification, though the name was given upon another occaſion. I ſay <hi>[outer]</hi> becauſe they are excluded from the Miniſtrations of the Sanctuary and the Altar, ver. 3.</p>
               <p>Their Work might be diſtinguiſhed into Synagogue-work and Temple-work; into temporary, or occaſional, and ſtanding work. But I ſhall put all together in ſeven heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were to bear the Tabernacle, and all the holy Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.15. ſo Chriſt ſupports and bears the Church: but this work was but temporary and occaſional, while the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle was in that ambulatory poſture; but when the flitting moving Tabernacle was changed into a fixed Temple, then this part of their Miniſtration was at an end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Levites were to aſſiſt the Prieſts in offering Sacrifices, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.28-31. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.34. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.16. to burne them on the Altar, and ſprinkle the Blood, was peculiar to the Prieſts: but the Levites might help in killing them, and other preparatory Adminiſtrations.</p>
               <p>As to the Goſpel of this, you know the true Sacrifice is Chriſt, and he is the Prieſt and the Levite too; he did all himſelf alone without any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Levites were to teach the people in the Law of the Lord: therefore ſcattered and diſperſed in their habitations up
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:96313:337"/>
and down among them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.10. <hi>they ſhall teach</hi> Iſrael <hi>thy Law</hi>— Mal. 2. ver. 7. <hi>the Prieſts Lips ſhould keep Knowledge, and and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his Mouth, for he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.7, 8, 9. Jehoſophat <hi>ſent Levites to teach.</hi> It is the Magiſtrates duty to provide for the teaching and inſtructing of his Subjects in the good knowledge of the Lord. This Chriſt doth, and this Goſpel-Miniſters alſo do; they ſhould teach the people, what the Lord hath taught them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They were to judge of Cauſes, and to determine Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies among the people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8, 9-12. the ſupream Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lying in the High Prieſt, ver. 11. Amaziah <hi>the Prieſt in thoſe things which belong to God ſhall preſide.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.8, 10. ſo there is ſpiritual Judgment of Diſcipline in the Church under the Goſpel, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.23, 24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They were to ſing the Songs of the Temple. That buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Temple-Muſick was committed to them, partly, as to the Pſalteries, Harps and Viols, though the Prieſts were to ſound the Trumpets, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.16, 17. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.12, 13. That which anſwers this, is the inward melody of the Joys and Graces of Gods Spirit.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Others of them were Treaſurers, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28. there is a Treaſure alſo in the Church of the New Teſtament, for which the Lord hath appointed Deacons whom he hath intruſted with it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Others were Porters to keep and watch the Gates of the Houſe of the Lord, which they did both by day, to keep back unclean perſons that they might nor enter into the Temple: ſo we find in <hi>Jehoiada</hi>'s time, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.19— <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.26. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.7, 8. and by night, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 134.1. Theſe ſeem to have been, as the Prieſts and Singers were, divided into four and twenty courſes, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.4, 5, 6. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 8.14. ſo the Gates of the Goſpel-Churches ſhould be kept and guarded, that ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and unclean perſons may not enter in, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third ſort of Temple-Officers were the Nethinims or Gibeonites, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9. for the ſervile work of the Temple, ver. 21, 23, 27. <hi>And</hi> Joſhua <hi>gave them that day to be Hewers of Wood, and
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:96313:338"/>
Drawers of Water, for the Congregation, and for the Altar of the Lord.</hi> Hence they are called Nethinims, from <hi>Nathan, dedit.</hi> They were afterwards methodized by <hi>David</hi> for the Temple-ſervice, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.20. and had Lodgings neer the Temple, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 3.26. though their dwellings were in their own Towns and Cities, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 7.73. <hi>the Nethenims dwelt in their Cities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their coming to the Iſraelites was to ſave their own Lives, a lawful end; but the means they uſed was very evil: for they came with a Ly in their mouths, as you all know the Story, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9. And as their means was bad: ſo the motive was but low; for they were under a legal work of fear and terror, and under guilt and guile of Spirit, as indeed guilt is uſually accompanied with guile and deceitfulneſs of heart. Yet out of this legal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, this legal fear and terror, they came to make their peace, I may call it in a ſenſe, their peace with God; for it was with the people of God, with the people of the true God: and God by his Providence did ſo order it, that their Lives were preſerved; and not only ſo, but they were devoted, though in a very low and mean way, to the Service of the Tabernacle of the true and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God. <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Princes (as ſome alledge) might have baniſhed them, being engaged by their Oath no further, but to the ſaving of their Lives: but they ſuffered them ſtill to dwell in the Land, and devoted them as the firſt Fruits of the Slaves or Servants to the Lord. Their work was to provide and bring in Water to the Lavers and molten Sea, and to provide Wood for the Fire of the Altar of Burnt-offering. The time when they did this their ſervice, ſeems to have been early in the morning, and late at night; before the Morning Sacrifice, which was at nine a clock in the morning, and after the Evening Sacrifice, which was not till three a clock in the afternoon. But by this means having ſuch acceſs into the Courts of the Temple, they came to ſee and know ſomething of the Worſhip of the true God. And, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.10. <hi>better be a Door-keeper in the Houſe of God, then to dwell in the Tents of wickedneſs;</hi> better be but a Gibeonite to the Worſhip of the true God, then the High Prieſt of <hi>Baal</hi> or <hi>Apollo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="671" facs="tcp:96313:338"/>Theſe Gibeonites, or Nethinims, were ſo incorporated into the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that as they were carried away to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> with the reſt of Gods people, ſo they returned with them, and accordingly are ſeveral times mentioned in <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This we may learn from the whole Hiſtory of them; that it is much better for men to ſeek after God, though they do it meerly out of legal fear and terror, as theſe poor creatures did, then wholly to neglect him. The Lord in the bringing home of his Elect, uſually begins with legal works, and then by degrees carries it on further in ſuch as belong to the Election of his Grace.</p>
               <p>And now you have ſeen the ſeveral kinds of theſe Temple-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. The next thing to be ſpoken to, is their Maintenance. For you may ask,</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How was all this large and numerous Hierarchy of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Officers maintained?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There was a large and plentiful proviſion made for them, which is the ſecond part of this Chapter, from ver. 8. to the end; no leſs then five and twenty verſes are employed upon this, beſide which, if you will have a full account of it, we muſt borrow Light from other Scriptures. Their Maintenance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted chiefly in theſe eight particulars, the three firſt whereof are mentioned in this Chapter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All the Offerings and Sacrifices that were given to the Lord, the Lord gave part thereof to theſe his Miniſters: ſo here, ver. 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Do ye not know, that they that wait at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar, and they which miniſter about holy things, live of the things of the Temple.</hi> 1 Cor. 9.13. The Meat-offerings, Sin-offerings, Treſpaſs-offerings, Heave-offerings, Wave-offerings were theirs, the right Shoulder, and the Wave-breſt was theirs, the two Cheeks and the Maw, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.3. and in the Burnt-offerings the Skin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They had the firſt Fruits of all things, and that of the beſt: ſo here in <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. ver. 12, 13, 15, 16, 17. of Corn, Oyl, Wine, of men and Beaſts, whereof men, the firſt-born of men, and of
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:96313:339"/>
beaſts that were not clean for Sacrifice, were redeemed with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, five ſhekels a head, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.4. and they had three ſorts of firſt Fruits. 1. Of the firſt ripe Ears of Corn offered at the Paſſover, which was Barly; becauſe that was firſt ripe in that Country, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.10. <hi>Lev.</hi> 2.14. 2. Firſt Fruits of Bread at Pentecoſt, and this of Wheat, which was then ripe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.15. 3. Firſt Fruits of all the other Fruits of the Earth, of which <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.4. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They had the tenths of all the Increaſe of the Land, ver. 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the tenth of which tenth went to the Prieſts, ver. 26.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They had Gleab-lands, forty eight Cities with their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs, for themſelves, and their Cattel. The Inſtitution whereof is in <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. the eight firſt verſes. The Performance is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 21. throughout the Chapter, whereof thirteen were given to the Prieſts, the reſt to the Levites, ſix of them were Cities of Refuge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They had voluntary Preſents and Contributions at the three ſolemn Feaſts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.16, 17.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They had Poll-mony, of a half ſhekel at every general Muſter of the people, and of the third part of a ſhekel yearly. Of the former you have the Ordinance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.12-16. it is there ſaid to be <hi>for the Service of the Tabernacle;</hi> which ſhews that the Levites had it, though withall the Lord there puts ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect alſo upon it. The ordaining of the latter you find, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 10.32.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Reſtitution-mony for Treſpaſſes and Injuries, often fell into their hands; which was the principal, with a fifth part ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.8.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They had a priviledge of exemption from all publick Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes and Aſſeſſments, that were laid on others, granted them by <hi>Artaxerxes, Ezr.</hi> 7.24.</p>
               <p>All which put together amounts to a very large and ample Maintenance. Some have obſerved, that though the Levites were not equal in number to the one and fortieth part of the people; yet their Revenue and yearly Income was above four times as much, as fell to the lot of the richeſt Tribe in all the
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:96313:339"/>
Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and that the Temple, and theſe ſacred Officers of it, had above a third part of the Income of the whole Land.</p>
               <p>The Inſtruction which the Apoſtle teacheth us out of all this, is the Maintenance of Goſpel-Miniſters. He diſputes the point at large, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. as from arguments of all ſorts, ſo from the equity and reaſon of this old Temple-ordinance.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But what neceſſity is there that Miniſters ſhould be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by others? For, can they not follow ſome other honeſt Calling, and yet preach too?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For a man to follow another Calling, and yet to be a conſtant Preacher, is neither lawful, nor poſſible ordinarily.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not lawful; becauſe it is the Ordinance and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Jeſus Chriſt, that the Miniſtry ſhould be a particular Calling; that is, that Miniſters ſhould employ their whole time upon it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13, 14, 15. <hi>Be thou wholly in them, give thy ſelf to reading,</hi> &amp;c. To think otherwiſe, argues a ſecret contempt of this Calling; and blindneſs of heart concerning the nature of it. Is it ſuch a ſmall thing in your eyes to preach the Goſpel? that this muſt be done as a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as a work upon the by, which is of ſo great weight and concernment, that it requires the whole man, and the utmoſt improvement of all his abilities, and of all his time and talents for the right diſcharging of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it is not lawful, ſo it is not poſſible ordinarily: as no man may preach conſtantly, ſo no man can preach conſtantly, that follows another Calling.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But they may, by the immediate aſſiſtance of the Spirit,</hi> ſay ſome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, the Spirit of God doth not give any ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate aſſiſtance in theſe times: and therefore it is preſumption to expect it. I ſay, it is not Faith, but preſumption to expect it: for Apoſtolical Gifts are ceaſed. A Miniſter that is called to that work, and is diligent in reading and meditation, and in Prayer to God, may expect aſſiſtance from the Spirit in this way: for God hath promiſed it. But he cannot expect it in the way of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelation, becauſe there is no ſuch promiſe. Now then, ſeeing God hath ordained, that the Miniſtry be a particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:96313:340"/>
ſo that it is not lawful for men that follow their Callings, to take upon them to be conſtant Preachers: and it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for one that is a conſtant Preacher to follow another Calling. It follows, that Miniſters either muſt be maintained, or elſe they muſt ſtarve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> There is alſo another Queſtion concerning the way and manner of Maintenance, <hi>whether it may be in any of theſe ways that were uſed under the Law, or whether they be not all ceaſed and aboliſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this the Anſwer is eaſie; that ſeeing the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Prieſts and Levites under the Law, was raiſed all manner of ways; the Maintenance of Goſpel-Miniſters muſt be in ſome of theſe, or there can be no Maintenance at all. For if Miniſters do receive Maintenance by the Free-will-offerings and voluntary Contributions of the people: ſo did the Levites under the Law. If Miniſters have Houſes to dwell in provided for them, the Legal Miniſtry had ſo too: If Miniſters have it by the Edict of the ſupream Magiſtrate, ſo had the Levites too, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 7.24. If Miniſters have their Maintenance ſetled by Law, by the conſent of the people, as by Act of Parliament. This way was uſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law likewiſe, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 21.1, 3. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 10.32. If Miniſters under the Goſpel receive Tythes, ſo did they alſo under the Law: only concerning Tythes it's obſervable, that the moſt of the other ways were not uſed till firſt inſtituted under the Law; yet Tythes were paid long before, as a Due to God, and to his uſe, long before the Aaronical Prieſthood, or Levitical Miniſtry was inſtituted and appointed: For <hi>Abraham</hi> paid Tythes to <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedek, Gen.</hi> 14.20. and <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 28.22. reſolves, <hi>of all that thou ſhalt give me, I will ſurely give the tenth unto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such ways and parts of their Maintenance, as were inſeparable appendants to the <hi>Types,</hi> as their parts of the Sacrifices, muſt needs be ceaſed, becauſe there are no ſuch Sacrifices under the Goſpel. But for the other ways of Maintenance, which were not of ſuch a nature, they may be lawful ſtill, for ought I know to the contrary. Thus I have gone through the Temple-Officers, both their kinds and their Maintenance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="675" facs="tcp:96313:340"/>And now to wind up all, I ſhall but briefly recapitulate and gather up the heads of things, and ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>All theſe old legal Types and Shadows may be ranged into theſe ſeven Claſſes, or general heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Perſonal Types,</hi> ſundry individual perſons <hi>before the Law,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Adam, Enoch, Noah, Melchizedek, Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were divers alſo <hi>under the Law,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua, Sampſon, David</hi> and <hi>Solomon, Elijah, Eliſha</hi> and <hi>Jonah, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel</hi> and <hi>Jehoſhuah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And beſides theſe individual perſons that were Types, there were alſo <hi>typical Ranks and Religious Orders of men under the Law,</hi> ſuch as their Nazarites, their Prophets, Prieſts and Kings.</p>
               <p>All theſe were perſonal Types, and this is the firſt Claſſis.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Occaſional Types,</hi> ſuch things as <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, <hi>Moſes</hi> his burning Buſh, the Pillar of Cloud and Fire, Manna, and Water out of the Rock, the Brazen Serpent, the Pool of <hi>Betheſda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And beſide ſuch <hi>typical things,</hi> there were <hi>typical actions and diſpenſations of Providence,</hi> as their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> their paſſing thorough the red Sea, and thorough the Wilderneſs, and thorough <hi>Jordan,</hi> and poſſeſſing the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and their Captivity and Deliverance out of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there were not only ſuch <hi>typical Mercies and Deliverances,</hi> but <hi>typical Vengeance and Deſtruction upon Enemies,</hi> the Flood, <hi>Sodom and Gomorrah, Egypt, Jericho, Babylon, Edom,</hi> were <hi>Types of Rome and Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the ſecond general head of Types, theſe tranſient and occaſional Types.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is, that <hi>initiating Seal of the Old Teſtament, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion;</hi> that famous Ordinance which ſtood in force about two thouſand years, much longer then the Temple and Temple-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth is, <hi>the holy Places;</hi> as the Tabernacle and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with all the holy Veſſels and Utenſils belonging to them, the Brazen Altar of Burnt-offering, the molten Sea and Lavers, the two Pillars of the Temple, the Golden Candleſtick, the Tables of
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:96313:341"/>
Shew-bread, the Golden Altar and Cenſer of Incenſe, the Ark, with all the glorious appurtenances thereof— This is the fourth Claſſis of them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth is, <hi>the Prieſthod, with all the Legal Miniſtry,</hi> and all the concernments thereof, the Rules of theſe Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, their holy miniſtring Garments, the Ephod, the Breſt-plate, the Urim and Thummim, the Mitre, the holy Crown, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration to their Office, their Adminiſtrations in their Office.</p>
               <p>And to the Prieſts belonged (as ſubordinate to them) the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> who were Porters, Singers, Treaſurers, Judges. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Nethinims.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The Legal Sacrifices and Purifications;</hi> Their Burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Meat-offerings, Peace-offerings, Sin-offerings, Treſpaſs-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; the Purifications of unclean Touches, unclean Meats, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Iſſues, and chiefly the Leproſie; both the Signs and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and likewiſe the Purifications of it, they were all typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſeventh and laſt is, <hi>the Jewiſh Feſtivals, or holy times and ſeaſons;</hi> as the Paſſover, Pentecoſt, the Feaſt of Tabernacles, the Feaſt of Trumpets, the Feaſt of Expiation, their New Moons, their Sabbaths, weekly every Saturday, as alſo every ſeventh year, and every fiftieth year, ſeven times ſeven, which is the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of the general heads of things, which you have heard ſpoken to, and the Goſpel-myſteries included in them brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened and unfolded.</p>
               <p>This is the proper and genuine method and order of them, which to have thus rehearſed may a little help and refreſh your memories.</p>
               <p>There are three things more which muſt needs be added and annexed unto all that hath been ſaid, each of which might have deſerved a diſtinct Diſcourſe by it ſelf. But I ſhall but name them, becauſe I would conclude at this time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That all this typical Diſpenſation is expired and aboliſhed by the exhibition of Jeſus Chriſt the truth and ſubſtance and ſcope of all;</hi> theſe Shadows are vaniſhed away by the riſing of that Sun
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:96313:341"/>
of Righteouſneſs; this is that which the great Apoſtle doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſſert, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. <hi>He hath blotted out the hand-writing of Ordinances that was againſt us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his Croſs.</hi> This the Jews do not believe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Goſpel-diſpenſation doth ſucceed, and is ſubſtituted inſtead thereof:</hi> ſo the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>God, who at ſundry times, and in divers manners ſpake in time paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Moſes</hi> the Servant of the Lord, we have Chriſt himſelf the Son of God; inſtead of the Law and the Prophets, we have the Goſpel and Evangeliſts, who give us an Hiſtory inſtead of Propheſie: they tell us that Chriſt is come; whereas the Law and the Prophets only ſaid, he ſhall come. The Jewes do not believe this neither: as they adhere to the Law, ſo they reject the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This Goſpel-diſpenſation is far more glorious then that old legal Diſpenſation.</hi> For is not the ſubſtance better then ſhadows? The Law from <hi>Mount Sion</hi> is more glorious then the Law from <hi>Mount Sinai:</hi> the Spirit is better then the Letter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. to ver. 11. The Letter there is not the written Word, and the Spirit the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſms of a deluded fancy, (as ſome have underſtood it;) but the Letter is the Law, and the Spirit is the Goſpel, as the whole Context ſhews.</p>
               <p>And look, as the Jews do not believe the two former: ſo the Papiſts and other ſuperſtitious Chriſtians do not believe this third; and therefore they ſeek to adde an external legal Pomp and Splendor, which is carnal, to the Worſhip of the Goſpel, to the ſpiritual Majeſty and Glory of the Goſpel, and Goſpel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which their carnal eyes are not able to ſee and to diſcern.</p>
               <p>Remember theſe three things, and carry them along with you.</p>
               <p>The Abolition an Expiration of the Law, with all the Types thereof.</p>
               <p>The Succeſſion and Subſtitution of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And the preeminence of Glory in the Goſpel above the Law.</p>
               <p>And now bleſſed be God, who hath carried me through this
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:96313:342"/>
Subject of the Types and Shadows of the Old Teſtament; a Subject in it ſelf uſeful and edifying, were it handled according to its worth.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, I have found ſome experience of aſſiſtance and help from God, ſince firſt I entred upon it, much beyond my own weakneſs and unworthineſs, I hope, through the influence of your Prayers, and through the Grace of Chriſt ſhining into a dark heart.</p>
               <p>But I have been but brief in divers things, which have deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a much larger and better explication. If you can ſay concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any part or portion of holy Scripture, that now you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it ſomething better, and that you ſee a little more into it then you did before; if you have found any refreſhings by what you have heard, any enlightenings and increaſings of Goſpel-light by it, live up thereto, and bleſs the Lord, who hath taken off the Veil from off <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Face, and the Veil from off your Hearts.</p>
